# {DRAFT} Decred Journal â€“ July 2019

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover tooltip text}")

{introduction, major news of the month ordered by impact}

Major news of July:

* Draft of the DEX spec was released - an important milestone on the route to refresh the crypto exchange experience.
* {Python library release and proposal}
* Staked DCR briefly crossed 50% for the first time.

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Code maintenance, bug fixes, test infrastructure. 

New major versions [rpcclient](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1807), [database](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1799), [blockchain/stake](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1803) and [dcrjson](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1779) modules were introduced to take advantage of recent improvements in other modules. Opportunity of major version bumps was taken to break tight coupling and remove unused code.

{1779 changed ~1K lines, 1788 nuked 4K lines (!) but it's hard to decrypt what it does. anything to add to the catch all statements above?}

A [workaround](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1801) for Go compiler's code generation issues was added to avoid the explosion of binary size of chaincfg/v2 module.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): Codebase upgrades and bug fixes. Large [refactoring](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1509) of JSON-RPC code and [removal](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1496) of obsolete gRPC code have been merged.

{any better comments?}

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): Bug fixes and small UI improvements. Responsive purchase ticket view [implemented](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2146). A ton of dependencies were [upgraded](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2156) to close a host of vulnerabilities.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): Work continues on the [redesign](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/77) of Politeia's interface. The other major task in July concerned the [integration](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/951) of tlog, from Google's open source [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian) data store on the backend as a replacement for git. tlog will improve scalability, allow records to be timestamped individually instead of in journals, and will allow for the a switch to a filesystem like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) in future.

{will login by username be deployed on Pi or is it CMS-only? https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/940}

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool): bug fixes, UI and performance improvements. Reworked [Connect to Wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/427) view and added the display of VSP's [block height](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/440) to see if it is healthy. More work to [decouple](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/227) dcrstakepool and dcrwallet (dcrstakepool should only talk to the stakepoold service that in turn manages the voting wallet).

{please provide an overview of dcrstakepool work in July}

Raedah Group has started work to improve the VSP auth APIs (no code published yet) {please elaborate what it does and add links, or drop if not enough info}.

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd): Upstream [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) commits up to July 8 have been [ported](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/36#issuecomment-509370199).

{SB: do we have a total number of PRs merged? is it still 270  as reported in June? do we have a commit/PR/date up to which we're caught up to lnd?}. 

The [lightning-faucet](https://github.com/decred/lightning-faucet) repo has migrated from @matheusd's GitHub to the official decred org, where the faucet saw minor improvements this month to the form for generating Lightning [invoices](https://github.com/decred/lightning-faucet/pull/9) and the [addition](https://github.com/decred/lightning-faucet/pull/10) of Continuous Integration (CI). Work has started on a new Pay Invoice form that will allow users to pay via the faucet (currently users must pay invoices on the command line with `dcrlncli`). 

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): Minor bug fixes and UI optimizations, as well as the ability to [rename accounts](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/386). 

Work is in progress to add [biometric authentication](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/343), [sound and vibration](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/399) to notifications, and a [stats page](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/397).

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): Bug fixes and UI optimizations, new translations to [Spanish](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/500), [Vietnamese](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/498) and [Portuguese](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/pull/497).

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata):

* reworked proposal page https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1446

Other:

* Draft of the DEX specification has been released and added to the new [dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex) repository.
* RG {maybe others?} have been working on [dcrextdata.raedahgroup.com](dcrextdata.raedahgroup.com), a package for collecting external data not yet found on dcrdata. {should we maybe put this under dcrdata, since it's related and may be merged?}
* RG is working on a mobile app for local person-to-person BTC/DCR trading (the work is in private repos for now).
* [bug bounty](https://bounty.decred.org/) website [update](https://twitter.com/degeri_crypto/status/1154776087374770176): added details for 3 new vulnerabilities. The program has processed a total of 67 submissions, with 9 being eligible for a payout, of which 8 have been patched and disclosed.
* {mention webwallet no longer supported, add links}

Decred Australia community has been building nicely. An [update](https://medium.com/@sahand.bagheri/decred-australia-building-a-community-brick-by-brick-89928041687e) shared last month recaps partnerships established, events organized, people attracted as well as next goals. This was covered in [June](201906.md)'s Media but turned out bigger than just an article.

Community stats as of Aug 1:

* Politeia users: 154 (-35, adjusted by new more accurate method of counting)
* Twitter followers: 40,572 (+93)

## Governance

In July the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 15,517 DCR and spent 10,344 DCR. Using July's daily average DCR/USD rate of $28.97, this is $450K received and $300K spent. As these payments were for work completed in June, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the June average daily rate of $28.90 {hardly worth repeating with such low volatility ;-)} - in which case the USD spent figure is $448K. As of Aug 1, Treasury balance is 627,514 DCR (16.8 million USD at $26.75).

{do we need _received_ figure for prev month? rr: probably not, have removed}

In July, 2 new proposals were submitted: 

* [Decred Fundamental Metrics Research Proposal - Phase 1](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/78b50f218106f5de40f9bd7f604b048da168f2afbec32c8662722b70d62e4d36) by @checkmate, a new contributor, requesting $12,000 for 3 months work on research and social media presence, plus $2,000 for work completed prior to this ([monetary premiums article](https://medium.com/@_Checkmatey_/monetary-premiums-can-altcoins-compete-with-bitcoin-54c97a92c6d4)). Voting started on Jul 30.

* [TinyDecred: A Python Toolkit for Decred](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/20e967dad9e7398901decf3cfe0acf4e0853f6558a62607265c63fe791b8b124) by @buck54321, a contractor working on dcrdata for the last year, requests $8,000 for work already completed on TinyDecred, a set of tools for interacting with the Decred blockchain in Python.

[Issue 19](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/politeia-digest/blob/master/issue-019.md) of Politeia Digest has more detail on July's proposal activity.

A [data-set](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research/blob/master/data/comments-and-updown-votes/pi-users.csv) and [short report](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research/blob/master/analysis/comments-and-updown-votes/users-review.md) has been prepared which aggregates the Politeia data on the basis of username, producing accurate figures for how often each user has commented and voted, and how well their comments have scored. 

## Network

Hashrate: July's hashrate opened at ~503 Ph/s and closed ~583 Ph/s, bottoming at 319 Ph/s and peaking at 687 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate distribution as of Aug2: F2Pool 20.78%, UUPool 18.96%, lab.antpool.com 16.50%, Poolin 9.51%, BTC.com 7.29%, Luxor 2.20%, BeePool 0.14%, Coinmine 0.12%, suprnova 0.08% and others 24.42% per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Sharp drop in hashrate 550-319 was observed on Jul 5 according to dcrstats.com, the hash rate quickly rose up again.There was a long some [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!NNzHoaSdnsbZDQOXJr:decred.org/$156238052013967KGajR:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) on the possible reasons for the drop and on its [accuracy](https://matrix.to/#/!NNzHoaSdnsbZDQOXJr:decred.org/$156245221914434sRKEL:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com). 

{helpful for PoS: https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000003/proof-of-stake?orgId=1&from=now-40d&to=now}

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 125.85 DCR (+5) per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 118.8-129.4 DCR. Locked amount was 4.86-5.04 million DCR, which corresponded to 48.5-49.61% of the available supply. 

The ticket prices got to the highest levels (129.46) since the sdiffalgorithm consensus chage. Dave gave us some [insight](https://matrix.to/#/!kdpEDksmOMNrlMqffD:decred.org/$156359151625133psHEo:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org) on if this could be considered an "ATH"

Nodes: Throughout [July](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1561970982782&to=1564562982782) there were around 171 listening nodes and 189-553 total nodes per dcr.farm. As of Aug 2, roughly 69.72% run v1.4.0, and 5.96% run v1.5.0(pre) dev builds.


As of [Aug 2](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/DHPdAO4Wz/lightning-network?orgId=1), the DCR testnet LN shows 18 nodes, 52 channels and a total capacity of 410 DCR.

{selected discussed topics, as bullet list or one paragraph per topic}

Selected topics:

* The #DecredChallenge [started](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1145764832362319872?s=20) on Jul 1 when @checkmate challenged Bitcoiners to spend a month looking into Bitcoin and come out believing it should not be #2, inviting people who are not persuaded of its merits to engage in a debate about it. It [evolved](https://twitter.com/RichardRed0x/status/1146132909713240065?s=20) [quickly](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1146136667448913921?s=20) into a meme, got a [hash tag](https://twitter.com/Ammarooni/status/1146171552213479425), and then (thanks mostly to @checkmate) it grew into a tweet course on reasons why Decred merits serious investigation (see below). 
* Another [article](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/decred-price-analysis-a-sustained-increase-in-mining-activity-2) was published which described Decred as a "Bitcoin fork", likely based on the use of this term in descriptions on [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decred/) and [Messari](https://messari.io/asset/decred) (which, to be fair, uses the more limited "Bitcoin codebase fork"). This is a mischaracterization which frustrates the community because "Bitcoin fork" would usually be interpreted to mean a coin which forked the Bitcoin Core software and/or BTC UTXO set - neither of which are true in Decred's case. "Bitcoin fork" does not reflect the fact that Decred's software was created from scratch by the same people who launched Decred, beginning its life as btcd, an independent golang implementation of a Bitcoin full node. @lukebp [tweeted](https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1155886623147429889) about this and received a response from Messari, @checkmate [expanded](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1155901635257929728) on @lukebp's comment to produce another chapter in the #DecredChallenge.
* @ammarooni took the #DecredChallenge and came out with some [concerns](https://twitter.com/Ammarooni/status/1148013517016113152?s=20) about attack vectors related to stakeholder liability for illegal proposals and the susceptibility of the LLC to seizure of funds. @lukebp and @jz responded with an explanation of how Decred is moving towards a full DAO and how this will address the concerns.
* The subject of whether to change the name for Decred's smallest units (atoms) or to integrate "credits" in the names for another denomination came up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/OfficialCryptos/status/1151603316167720960) and was discussed in chats and on this GitHub [issue](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/129). Developers pointed out that "atom" is used thousands of times in the Decred codebase, which discouraged some proponents of the change but not others. 
* @elian gave a Q&A with Crypto Hispano, published on [steemit](https://steemit.com/btc/@cryptohispano01/decred-q-and-a)

> A protocol needs to be able to adapt to those changes.
> The people making decisions about those changes should be the people with skin in the game, i.e. the stakeholders.

## Markets

In July DCR was trading between USD 25.20-35.64 / BTC 0.00262-0.00296. The average daily rate was $28.97.

After brefiely making a run for 13000 USD, Bitcoin prices went down and has been mostly bobbing the 10000 USD mark most of July.

Chris Burniske of Placeholder VC (holders of Decred and Zcash) provided a good [summary](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/placeholder-considerations-resources-governance-and-legitimacy-in-nu4/34045) of the situation facing the Zcash community as the founders reward expires, advocating for a continuation of 20% block reward to project development for another 4 years, with a split of 70% to "Protocol Development" and 30% to "Growth Funds".

Zooko Wilcox published a [personal letter](https://medium.com/@zooko_25893/a-personal-letter-about-the-possibility-of-a-new-zcash-dev-fund-f6d30df64392) about the possibility of a new Zcash dev fund, which explains that he always knew that the time would come when funding would run out and create a problem that could only be solved through a "messy and difficult process" such as the Zcash community is currently going through. Zooko stated again that he cannot be the one to make the decision and that it should come from the community, but as the CEO of ECC he has considerable influence in the community, and the community has no established method of making decisions.

All of the various options being considered have been helpfully summarized in this [megathread](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/future-of-zcash-dev-funding-megathread-everything-in-one-place/34063). As Chris Burniske remarked in his post, the first question is how to make the decision about the decision in a way which is perceived as legitimate. Given time constraints Chris advocates the use of polling to gauge preference for the various options, with a final decision made using the ECC and Zcash Foundation 2-of-2 multisig. Zooko stated that the ECC will announce a method of decision-making in early Aug.

Nebulous, the company building the Sia network, announced the [completion](https://sia.tech/funding2019) of a $3.25 million seed round with participation by a number of venture capitalists. 

Funding has also been the subject of some discussion in the Ethereum community, with more [attention](https://research.circle.com/insights/the-great-ethereum-funding-debate) being paid to [EIP-2025](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2025.md), which would add 0.0055 ETH per block for 18 months (17k ETH in total) to fund ETH 1.X development (as the main developers focus on ETH 2.0). The block rewards would be used to pay back a loan which the teams working in 4 different areas would receive to multi-sig contract addresses.

As with any controversial Ethereum Improvement Proposal, it is difficult for outsiders to know if EIP-2025 will go anywhere. A [tweet](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1154733914881179648?s=20) from Vitalik stating that it seems to have little support probably indicates that it won't be included in the Istanbul hard fork.

Another Circle Research [article](https://research.circle.com/insights/degrees-of-architectural-decentralization-to-infura-and-beyond) published about Ethereum concerns the centrality of Infura, a service company created by Consensys which allows dpp developers to sidestep setting up and running their own nodes. The article considers the difficulty and increasing demands of running a full node (space requirements have increased 25-48% year to date) as causing a decrease in the number of full nodes from 12,000 in Dec 2018 to 8,000 in July 2019. Infura is welcome because it allows Ethereum developers to avoid the inconvenience of interfacing with the blockchain directly, but it introduces a central point of failure for the 50,000 dapps and developers who rely on it. Infura is in turn reliant on AWS services to run its nodes.

The /r/ethtrader [Donuts experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/donuts), where subreddit participants earn points based on their subreddit karma and use these to participate in polls, is moving into another [phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/c3f1ku/the_next_phase_for_donuts/). Smart contracts have been prepared which will allow Donuts to be move to the Ethereum blockchain, and some reddit admins are facilitating this on the reddit end. As the donuts are being "decentralized", the polls are to become non-binding signal votes, due to fears in the community about on chain governance. This appears to be controversial choice, based on comments on the announcement, and there is some confusion about what the purpose of Donuts are.

Aragon [completed](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-3/) its 3rd round of governance proposal voting, 11 proposals were submitted and 8 were approved for voting by the Aragon Association. 7 of these proposals were approved , all with 99% or greater yes votes, 4 were unanimous (with 1 or less ANT token voting no). ANT turnout was 2.6% average across the 8 proposals.

[AGP-64](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-64.md) signals support for Quiet Ending Voting, which would extend the duration of AGP voting if the outcome is flipped towards the end of the voting period. This is in response to the [observation](https://www.evanvanness.com/post/184616403861/aragon-vote-shows-the-perils-of-onchain-governance) that late voting by a whale had swayed the outcome of previous AGPs. This proposal does not specify a particular implementation but signals support for resources to be invested in developing quiet ending voting for Aragon.

[AGP-59](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-59.md) mandates a minimum length for discussion period on AGP submissions. [AGP-70](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-70.md) signals support for shifting management of the Nest grant program away from the Aragon Association and to a DAO, AGP-71 extended the budget of the Nest program by 600k DAI and 300k ANT. [AGP-73](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-73.md) is the biggest budget proposal, with further flock funding for Autark of 1.6 million DAI and 487k ANT. The rejected proposal called for development of a native mobile app for Aragon voting.

Dash [completed](https://blog.dash.org/the-dash-investment-foundation-supervisor-election-results-96a28309744b) the first annual elections for positions as supervisors of the Dash Investment Foundation, using some software custom [made](https://blog.dash.org/trust-protector-election-software-93ed67c7455b) for this purpose.

Another round of the Tezos protocol amendment process is underway, after the Brest proposal by TzScan Baker failed to achieve enough upvotes to progress. Cryptium Labs [injected](https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/babylon-proposal-injected.html) a proposal called Babylon, prepared jointly with Nomadic Labs, on Jul 26, then an amended version 2.0 on Aug 2. This amendment would make a number of changes to the protocol, including a new variant of the consensus algorithm and new Michelson features, and a new 5% proposal quorum is introduced which will prevent the proposal with the most upvotes progressing to the second phase unless it has support from at least 5% of the stake. This will allow for proposals with little support (like Brest) to be rejected earlier, and the proposal cycle to restart more quickly thereafter.

The 0x decentralized exchange protocol team [announced](https://blog.0xproject.com/shut-down-of-0x-exchange-v2-0-contract-and-migration-to-patched-version-6185097a1f39) that a security vulnerability had been reported by a 3rd-party security researcher, and shut down the exchange contract as a precaution. The 0x smart contract pipeline was patched and re-deployed the next day.
