## Governance

In July the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {n} DCR and spent {n} DCR. Using July's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in June, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the June average daily rate of ${n.nn} - in which case the USD received/spent figures are ${n}K/${n}K. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {n} DCR ({n.nn} million USD at ${n.nn}).

{do we need _received_ figure for prev month?}
