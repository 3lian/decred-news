## Governance

{high level recap of decision-making activity, most important events, defer to Politeia Digest for the rest}

In {month} the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {} DCR and spent {} DCR. Using {month}'s daily average DCR/USD rate of ${}, this is ${}K received and ${}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in December, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the December average daily rate of ${} - in which case the USD received/spent figures are ${}K/${}K.

Discussions about amending Decred Constitution https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/107 and ratifying the new version via Politeia vote, the goal of this iteration is to remove outdated/irrelevant parts, rather than a full rewrite.

* {summary please}

Counterfeiting vulnerability was [discovered](https://z.cash/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/) in Zcash. "This vulnerability is so subtle that it evaded years of analysis by expert cryptographers focused on zero-knowledge proving systems and zk-SNARKs.". It was silently patched with the Sapling network upgrade that occurred on Oct 28, 2018.

{governance, funding, forks, chain splits, controversy}

Grin developer published his [disappointments](https://www.grin-forum.org/t/solved-early-disappointments/3682) about the innovative project being unable to attract modest funding. After the news spread, the [campaign](https://grin-tech.org/yeastplume) quickly raised EUR 67,580 out of EUR 55,000 target. This is interesting in context of another investment. As Breaker Mag [noted](https://breakermag.com/as-decred-turns-three-its-still-set-on-real-decentralization/), Grin "attracted [tens of millions of dollars](https://www.coindesk.com/grin-launch-crypto-interest-from-deep-pocketed-investors) in mining investment, but had some trouble raising a mere $62,000 to pay its lead developer for six months."

Ethereum holders are [signaling](http://www.progpowcarbonvote.com/) whether they want to change mining algorithm to ProgPoW. The vote started with strong [opposition](https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/02/14/98-of-ethereum-vote-against-progpow) of the change (98% No), but later flipped to strong support (85% Yes). The vote is not binding. Participation is 1.1% of coin supply as of Feb 16 {update}.

{DEX}

Binance is [launching](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/02/07/binance-moves-away-from-ethereum-as-it-prepares-to-launch-dex/) its DEX based on Cosmos' Tendermint protocol and DPoS. The listing fee will "probably be close to $100,000" to "reduce the number of spam or scam projects". In contrast, Decred's DEX design has no listing fees and doesn't require an extra blockchain for its operation.
