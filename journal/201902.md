## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): mempool policy tightened by allowing [one less](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1596) double spend of a ticket and [rejecting](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1597) same block double spends. Wallet-specific types [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1607) from dcrd and [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1394) to dcrwallet where they belong, this simplified changes to dcrwallet and also triggered [refactoring](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1613) in dcrd to provide stronger module boundaries and simplify the dependency graph _(note how the pull request cares for reviwers)_. Non-root Go module replacements were [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1599) - this helps to ensure that latest code from all modules is being tested, and to keep them independently accurate for external consumers.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): v1 ticketbuyer was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1396) after being deprecated for several releases.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): [upgrade](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2009) to Electron 4 allowed to make startup on Windows [more robust](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2017). Added [exit alert](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1989) when ticketbuyer is running. Design phase for multiple [responsive views](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3AMariaPleshkova+created%3A2019-02-01..2019-02-28) is finished and ready for implementation

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): new features: highlighting of new comments since last visit and email [notifications](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/680) after password change ([suggested](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/673) via bug bounty program).

Epic cache layer work was [merged](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/660)! Thanks @lukebp and all reviewers/testers. This paves the way for a lot of site performance improvements. Among other completed work are CLI tool [improvements](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/707) and [fsck](https://github.com/decred/dcrtime/pull/46) (file system verification tool) for dcrtime.

In progress:

* Work [started](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/689) to scale www database using CockroachDB.
* A decision [was made](https://matrix.to/#/!VFRvyndKpzcLrVslQD:decred.org/$15507680085008gMbtf:decred.org) to move the code for contractor management system in politeia and politeiagui repositories to avoid the overhead of maintaining two codebase forks and keeping them in sync.
* Change of the default comment sorting algorithm is being [discussed](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/1022).

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): many bug fixes and minor improvements are lined up to be merged, see [project board](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/projects/1) for detailed progress.

[Chinese](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/336) and [Vietnamese](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/333) translations are in progress.

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): TestFlight [beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/dvq51tCh) was updated and work is ongoing to bring it up to par with dcrandroid. Progress can be tracked on [this board](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/projects/1).

First release candidate is planned in a month, and there will likely be a point release to dcrandroid then as well.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): added feature to show data about [Politeia proposals](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1016), added [fiat conversions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1049) (supply, treasury, ticket price), mempool page [rework](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/982), endpoints to get [raw blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1032) and [raw headers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1035), added [cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1051) package.

Discussion [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1022) how to calculate cost of 51% attack on dcrdata.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): @matheusd [shared](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$1549497567273IPjZq:decred.org) his position, some background and plans for ticket splitting. @david recorded an instructional [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L8P7hL5v6w) that walks through the setup.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): new page explaining [Politeia Censorship](https://docs.decred.org/governance/politeia/politeia-censorship/) and how to prove you've been censored, new [Upgrading Decrediton](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/decrediton/upgrading-decrediton/) page, list of testnet VSPs added to [Using Testnet](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/using-testnet/) page, P2PKH address generation flow diagram added to [Address Details](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/address-details/) page. The search [is back](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/846).

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): content and translations updates. Implementation of the News and Posts page [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/561).

Other:

* [voting.decred.org](https://voting.decred.org/) dashboard now shows past agendas too. jQuery was [removed](https://github.com/decred/hardforkdemo/pull/213) to the delight of those who understand.
* Replacement of Google reCAPTCHA with self-hosted solution was [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/281) - huge step in improving [stakeholder's privacy](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/25). Thanks to all developers and testers of this patch.
* Trivia: did you know that Decred heavily [discourages](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$15497657664963CvzUr:decred.org) creation of dust outputs?
* [PoC UI](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/8) for atomic swaps made a few steps.

## Governance

In February the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 14,878 DCR and spent 17,311 DCR. Using February's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${}, this is ${}K received and ${}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in January, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the January average daily rate of $17.05 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $254K/$295K. As of {}, Treasury balance is {} DCR ({} USD at ${}).

Discussion started to amend Decred Constitution and ratify the new version with a Politeia vote. The initial goal was to remove outdated/irrelevant parts and add missing parts with minimum changes. During the discussion several people asked if we need constitution at all, considering that it is not binding. Links to all discussions and proposed changes are collected in [this issue](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/107).

A new [@pi_crumbs](https://twitter.com/pi_crumbs) Twitter account notifies its followers when proposals are created or modified, and when voting starts or finishes. Currently operated manually by @richardred, but automation is discussed.

Another account called [@slices_of_pi](https://twitter.com/slices_of_pi) posts commentary on Politeia activity written by human.

For greater detail, analysis and commentary see @richardred's excellent Politeia Digest [issue 10](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-10-jan-1-feb-18-2018-202cde71a19d) and [issue 11](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-11-feb-19-feb-28-2019-46befddb09fe) which the above summary is based on.

{PoW, ASIC resistance, tech}



A [study](https://medium.com/@MoneroCrusher/analysis-more-than-85-of-the-current-monero-hashrate-is-asics-and-each-machine-is-doing-128-kh-s-f39e3dca7d78) of Monero nonces documented differing patterns in the nonce distribution when ASICs were mining on the network, it considers the methods ASIC miners may take to disguise their presence and how they can be detected. The study speculates that 85% of the Monero hashrate comes from ASICs at time of writing.

A counterfeiting vulnerability was [discovered](https://z.cash/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/) in Zcash in early 2018. "This vulnerability is so subtle that it evaded years of analysis by expert cryptographers focused on zero-knowledge proving systems and zk-SNARKs.". It was silently patched with the Sapling network upgrade that occurred on Oct 28, 2018, and this [post](https://z.cash/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/) on Feb 5 explained how the vulnerability had been dealt with within Zcash and how other affected coins (like Horizen and Komodo) were notified. The nature of Zcash cryptography is such that it is difficult to determine if any ZEC was counterfeited while the vulnerability was present, the Zcash team reporting on the bug believe it had not been exploited because “discovery of the vulnerability would have required a high level of technical and cryptographic sophistication that very few people possess.”

A Grin developer published a forum [post](https://www.grin-forum.org/t/solved-early-disappointments/3682) expressing disappointment that a request for donations to fund one of the developers had not been filled after two weeks of the network being online - and threatening to take 20% of the block rewards to fund development. After the news spread, the [campaign](https://grin-tech.org/yeastplume) quickly raised EUR 67,580, surpassing the EUR 55,000 target. As Breaker Mag [noted](https://breakermag.com/as-decred-turns-three-its-still-set-on-real-decentralization/), Grin "attracted [tens of millions of dollars](https://www.coindesk.com/grin-launch-crypto-interest-from-deep-pocketed-investors) in mining investment, but had some trouble raising a mere $62,000 to pay its lead developer for six months."

Ethereum holders are holding another [signaling carbonvote](http://www.progpowcarbonvote.com/) about whether they want to change mining algorithm to ProgPoW. The vote started with strong [opposition](https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/02/14/98-of-ethereum-vote-against-progpow) to the change (98% No), but later flipped to strong support (94% Yes) as of 4 March (with 3% of circulating ETH having voted). While carbonvote has no official place in Ethereum's governance, the method is being used because:

> We have noticed a lot of trolling and shills on both sides of the debates from anonymous accounts on forums, youtube, telegram, glitter, reddit and twitter. There is no way to know if these accounts are real people who actually have economic stakes in ethereum, or are simply fake troll or shill accounts funded by one side of the debate.

Tezos started [voting](https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/athens-proposals-injected.html) for the first [amendment](https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/athens-our-proposals-for-the-first-voted-amendment.html) to its protocol on February 25 ([simple guide](https://medium.com/tezos-spotlight/tezos-the-first-amendment-a-laymans-guide-7424ef1d3e13), [detailed guide](https://medium.com/tezos/amending-tezos-b77949d97e1e) to amendment process). The amendment process has 4 phases, each lasting 8 "cycles" (a cycle lasts around 3 days, so each phase lasts for around 24 days). In the first phase bakers submit and upvote proposals. There are 2 proposals being evaluated now in the first phase, they both increase the gas limit but one also decreases the minimum "roll size" (amount of XTZ required to be a baker). It is interesting to note that Kialo is being [used](https://www.kialo.com/tezos-protocol-amendment-1-25295) by some Tezos community members to discuss these proposals. When the first phase ends, the most upvoted proposal will progress to phase 2, where it must be approved by at least 80% of bakers. If the criteria are met, this is followed by a testing phase in which a testnet fork with the changes applied is created and runs for 48 hours (a further testnet matching the proposal may be run for the rest of this phase to allow further testing). After the testing phase, bakers vote on whether the changes should be activated, with an 80% supermajority required. After this 4th phase the changes are activated (or not) and the cycle begins again with new proposals.

Dash v0.13.1 was released on Feb 8 to "accelerate adoption of the Dash Core v0.13". Dash Core [v0.13](https://blog.dash.org/dash-core-v0-13-on-mainnet-dc9609b0f6f9) was intended to activate [DIP3](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0003.md) but it had an activation threshold of 80% blocks signalling support from the PoW miners and masternodes in a 7 day window before activation would begin. After failing to meet these criteria for around 24 days, it was decided that the criteria are too stringent and that the requirement for masternodes to signal could be dropped. When enough PoW miners adopt v0.13.1 the change would activate one week later (it [activated](https://blog.dash.org/product-update-february-21-2019-5f067b62df00) around Feb 26).

0x protocol (ZRX) held its [first](https://blog.0xproject.com/how-to-participate-in-the-zeip-23-vote-eaa861298033) token holder vote from February 18 - February 25. The vote was to approve [ZEIP-23](https://blog.0xproject.com/zeip-23-trade-bundles-of-assets-fe69eb3ed960) and enable "trade bundles of assets". The proposal was [approved](https://0x.org/vote) with 99% Yes votes by 5,061,033 ZRX (0.86% of the circulating supply).

The NEM Foundation's funding proposal [started](https://forum.nem.io/t/nem-foundation-update-vote-for-funding-proposal-2019/22007) voting on Feb 15 and voting was open for 5 days. The funding proposal [passed](https://forum.nem.io/t/vote-for-nem-foundation-funding-proposal-2019-approved-by-the-community/22060) with 90% Yes votes and 10% No votes - with votes from 4.56% of the "Proof of Importance" (NEM's way of weighting holders' influence). The vote was conducted on the basis that a 65% supermajority of Yes votes was required, and at least 3% of the network's POI must vote Yes as a quorum requirement. Voting was conducted from within the NEM wallet by sending 0 XEM transactions to a Yes or No address. Another concurrent proposal to fund "NEM Labs" was also successful, with a similar level of participation and 98.8% approval. The NEM Foundation proposal asked for $8 million in XEM (figure is surprisingly hard to find, could only be found in a [google doc presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nMR_1ajVcpdGW7g8I0p7ZGh88tZ1SL5RzG5TsLW6Qnk/edit#slide=id.p2)), while the NEM Labs proposal asked for $3.27 million.

{DEX}

Binance is [launching](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/02/07/binance-moves-away-from-ethereum-as-it-prepares-to-launch-dex/) its DEX based on Cosmos' Tendermint protocol and DPoS. The listing fee will "probably be close to $100,000" to "reduce the number of spam or scam projects". In contrast, Decred's DEX design has no listing fees and doesn't require an extra blockchain for its operation.
