## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): mempool policy tightened by allowing [one less](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1596) double spend of a ticket and [rejecting](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1597) same block double spends. Wallet-specific types [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1607) from dcrd and [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1394) to dcrwallet where they belong, this simplified changes to dcrwallet and also triggered [refactoring](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1613) in dcrd to provide stronger module boundaries and simplify the dependency graph _(note how the pull request cares for reviwers)_.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): v1 ticketbuyer was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1396) after being deprecated for several releases.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): [upgrade](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2009) to Electron 4 allowed to make startup on Windows [more robust](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2017). Added [exit alert](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1989) when ticketbuyer is running. Design phase for multiple [responsive views](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3AMariaPleshkova+created%3A2019-02-01..2019-02-28) is finished and ready for implementation

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): epic cache layer work was [merged](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/660)! Thanks @lukebp and all reviewers/testers. This paves the way for a lot of site performance improvements. Other completed work: email [notifications](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/680) after password change ([suggested](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/673) via bug bounty program), CLI tool [improvements](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/707), [fsck](https://github.com/decred/dcrtime/pull/46) (file system verification tool) for dcrtime, bug fixes.

In progress:

* Work [started](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/689) to scale www database using CockroachDB.
* A decision [was made](https://matrix.to/#/!VFRvyndKpzcLrVslQD:decred.org/$15507680085008gMbtf:decred.org) to move the code for contractor management system in politeia and politeiagui repositories to avoid the overhead of maintaining two codebase forks and keeping them in sync.

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): [Chinese](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/336) and [Vietnamese](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/333) translations are in progress.

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): work ongoing to bring it up to par with Android, progress can be tracked on [this board](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios/projects/1).

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): added feature to show data about [Politeia proposals](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1016), added [fiat conversions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1049) (supply, treasury, ticket price), mempool page [rework](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/982), endpoints to get [raw blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1032) and [raw headers](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1035), added [cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/1051) package.

Discussion [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1022) how to calculate cost of 51% attack on dcrdata.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): @matheusd [shared](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$1549497567273IPjZq:decred.org) his position, some background and plans for ticket splitting. @david recorded an instructional [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L8P7hL5v6w) that walks through the setup.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): new page explaining [Politeia Censorship](https://docs.decred.org/governance/politeia/politeia-censorship/) and how to prove you've been censored, new [Upgrading Decrediton](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/decrediton/upgrading-decrediton/) page, list of testnet VSPs added to [Using Testnet](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/using-testnet/) page, P2PKH address generation flow diagram added to [Address Details](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/address-details/) page. The search [is back](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/846).

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): content and translations updates. Implementation of the News and Posts page [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/561).

Other:

* [voting.decred.org](https://voting.decred.org/) dashboard now shows past agendas too. jQuery was [removed](https://github.com/decred/hardforkdemo/pull/213) to the delight of those who understand.
* Replacement of Google reCAPTCHA with self-hosted solution was [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/281) - huge step in improving [stakeholder's privacy](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/25). Thanks to all developers and testers of this patch.
* Trivia: did you know that Decred heavily [discourages](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$15497657664963CvzUr:decred.org) creation of dust outputs?
* [PoC UI](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/8) for atomic swaps made a few steps.
* QTUM support [merged](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/pull/93) in atomicswap, POLIS support [removed](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/pull/99).
* Work [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/19) to add DNSSEC support to dcrseeder.
* [authit](https://github.com/decred/authit), the UI for dcrtime is now hosted at [timestamp.decred.org](https://timestamp.decred.org/).

## Governance

{high level recap of decision-making activity, most important events, defer to Politeia Digest for the rest}

In {month} the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {} DCR and spent {} DCR. Using February's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${}, this is ${}K received and ${}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in January, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the January average daily rate of $17.05 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are ${}K/${}K.

Discussions about amending Decred Constitution https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/107 and ratifying the new version via Politeia vote, the goal of this iteration is to remove outdated/irrelevant parts, rather than a full rewrite.

* during the discussion several people asked if we need constitution at all, given it is not binding

## Mining

## Integrations

{new items of infrastructure or updates from existing}

Exchange integrations:

* Vertbase DCR/USD {where it is based, is USD real? first real fiat pair?}

Counterfeiting vulnerability was [discovered](https://z.cash/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/) in Zcash. "This vulnerability is so subtle that it evaded years of analysis by expert cryptographers focused on zero-knowledge proving systems and zk-SNARKs.". It was silently patched with the Sapling network upgrade that occurred on Oct 28, 2018.

{governance, funding, forks, chain splits, controversy}

Grin developer published his [disappointments](https://www.grin-forum.org/t/solved-early-disappointments/3682) about the innovative project being unable to attract modest funding. After the news spread, the [campaign](https://grin-tech.org/yeastplume) quickly raised EUR 67,580 out of EUR 55,000 target. This is interesting in context of another investment. As Breaker Mag [noted](https://breakermag.com/as-decred-turns-three-its-still-set-on-real-decentralization/), Grin "attracted [tens of millions of dollars](https://www.coindesk.com/grin-launch-crypto-interest-from-deep-pocketed-investors) in mining investment, but had some trouble raising a mere $62,000 to pay its lead developer for six months."

Ethereum holders are [signaling](http://www.progpowcarbonvote.com/) whether they want to change mining algorithm to ProgPoW. The vote started with strong [opposition](https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/02/14/98-of-ethereum-vote-against-progpow) of the change (98% No), but later flipped to strong support (85% Yes). The vote is not binding. Participation is 1.1% of coin supply as of Feb 16 {update}.

The listing fee will "probably be close to $100,000" to "reduce the number of spam or scam projects". In contrast, Decred's DEX design has no listing fees and doesn't require an extra blockchain for its operation.
