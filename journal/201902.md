{governance, funding, forks, chain splits, controversy}

Grin developer published his [disappointments](https://www.grin-forum.org/t/solved-early-disappointments/3682) about the innovative project being unable to attract modest funding. After the news spread, the [campaign](https://grin-tech.org/yeastplume) quickly raised EUR 67,580 out of EUR 55,000 target.

{DEX}

Binance is [launching](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/02/07/binance-moves-away-from-ethereum-as-it-prepares-to-launch-dex/) its DEX based on Cosmos' Tendermint protocol and DPoS. The listing fee will "probably be close to $100,000" to "reduce the number of spam or scam projects". In contrast, Decred's DEX design has no listing fees and doesn't require an extra blockchain for its operation.
