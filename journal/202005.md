## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- reworked HTTPS [seeding](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2188) { is there a place to read on HTTPS vs DNS seeding? is HTTPS superior and is Decred network migrating to it? }
- [banning](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2110) peers that don't follow the wire protocol
- more code migrated to the Go 1.13 error handling

In progress:

- TSPEND opcode needed for decentralized control of the Treasury by the stakeholders was successfully [tested](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1263185839028350976) on testnet.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- added client [package](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1726) for JSON-RPC calls
- ability to request blocks [concurrently](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1730) { is it a major speedup in SPV mode? any comment appreciated }
- ability to save [per-ticket](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1737) vote preferences (step towards ticket-based VSP)

In progress:

- [hardened](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1743) account support for the next VSP API

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- code refactoring, more components reused from pi-ui
- codebase [prettified](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2481) with automated rules to improve readability
- UI tweaks

In progress:

- [mixed](https://twitter.com/_vctt/status/1265397168317366283) transactions

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

- RFP process support on the [backend](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1054) and the [GUI](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1910) - big change long in development { how "done" is it? }
- admin utility to [change email](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1178) address
- backend support for [shorter](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/900) proposal URLs
- arrow key [navigation](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1878) for attached images
- [workaround](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1944) for the duplicate comments issue
- progress towards viewing Politeia with [no javascript](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1834) { what's the delivery/deployment status/plans? }
- lots of bug fixes

In progress:

- admin feature to query [code stats](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1185) for contractors

CMS:

- [all-contractor](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1104) vote for contentious DCCs, weighted by the number of billed hours over the previous 6 months - final part of implementing the DCC process [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4)
- [utility](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1179) to test DCC issuance and DCC vote processes

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool):

In progress:

- Work towards [ticket-based](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/625) VSP { is this PR superseded by vspd? }

[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd):

vspd is a from-scratch implementation of VSP software that will bring a huge improvement to the privacy of VSP users, and by extension, the security of the Decred network. It will be also much easier to use for having no registration, no emails, no CAPTCHAs, and no redeem scripts to back up. Check the [announced](https://blog.decred.org/2020/06/02/A-More-Private-Way-to-Stake/) for more details.

{ hint:

- check dcrdata.org (preferred), dcrstats.com and charts.dcr.farm to get the numbers
- use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

Hashrate: [May's hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=k9nb7wvw-kavn2b1a&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~357 Ph/s and closed ~386 Ph/s, bottoming at 260 Ph/s and peaking at 541 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool [hashrate distribution](https://dcrstats.com/pow) as of June 1: UUPool 38%, Poolin 18.5%, lab.antpool.com 11.5%, F2Pool 1.5%, Luxor 1.25%, BTC.com 1.25%, BeePool 0.09%, CoinMine 0.03%, Suprnova 0.02% and others ~27.8%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was 141.48 DCR (+3.68). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=k9nb7wvw-kavn2b1a&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) varied between 132.8-159.1 DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=k9nb7wvw-kavn2b1a&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) was 5.59-5.8 million DCR, which corresponded to 48.7-50.2% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=k9nb7wvw-kavn2b1a&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time&visibility=true-false) in PoS.

Block size: This month, the blockchain size grew by {n} MB. [Block size](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=block-size&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.n}-{n.n} with an average of {n.n} KB. {any interesting fact about this month's blocks}

Transactions: In May, Decred users made {n} regular transactions and bought {n} tickets. {n} tickets were rewarded for voting and {n} were revoked. On average, there were {n} regular DCR transactions and {n} new tickets per day.

{ hint: for dcr.farm set the zoom to show exactly UTC month 1st 00:00:00 - next month 1st 00:00:00 }

Nodes: Throughout [May](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1588291200000&to=1590969600000) {set zoom to show the month} there was an average of {} public listening nodes and {} total nodes per dcr.farm. Version distribution: {vx.y.z: n% (+n%), ...}.

{any interesting analysis or events in the network}

- https://formalverification.substack.com/p/in-the-network-decred
  - new metric analyzed is the ratio of hashrate to USD block reward which represents miners' risk
  - notes a decline of several metrics since Jan 2020

> The key takeaway here is Decred is trading at PoW issuance to-date. If we assume miners operate at near marginal costs, Decred is no longer trading at a premium to total miner USD input as we saw in 2017 and the first half of 2018. This also does not even factor in the resource costs by stakers who also play a crucial role in Decred’s consensus layer which we will cover next. Put differently, Decred is trading at a loss relative to total USD input to the network (PoW and PoS).

## Integrations

{ hint: new pieces of infrastructure or updates from existing: VSPs, exchanges, wallets, OTC desks, payment processors. use bullets or paragraphs, whatever looks best in a given month's compilation }

{ check https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/commits/master for changes to the VSP list } Checked None

[Transak](https://global.transak.com/) brought a new way to purchase DCR with a debit card for the US, EU, and residents to many other countries thanks to a [partnership](https://twitter.com/transak_finance/status/1265690509844131846) with Wyre. "Transak uses smart contracts to connect the end-user to liquidity on centralized and decentralized exchanges. Users will have to input simple KYC information, but the process from start to finish will take less than 5 minutes". Now Transak is live in 32 countries, supporting 14 fiat currencies and 300+ cryptoassets.
