{introduction, major news of the month ordered by impact}

## Development

{add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warranets a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): 

SB: lots of smaller looking PRs this mo, not sure what is important or if there's a larger theme here...

* certgen: Support Ed25519 cert generation on Go 1.13 {SB: update to support new version of go} https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1757
* edwards: Introduce v2 module.{SB: not sure what Edwards module is, is it important?} https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1762 

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

Merged

* curve https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1468
* rpc: explicitly specify immature & live tickets in StakePoolUserInfo https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1478 {SB: perhaps important: "This change explicitly states whether a ticket is immature or live rather than the previous implementation that grouped both immature & live tickets as live."}
* Switch default TLS elliptic curve from P-521 to P-256 https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1468 {SB: seems important? "P-256 is implemented in constant time while P-521 is not, making it more secure against side channel attacks. In addition, this curve has broader software support. In particular, P-521 is unusable from BoringSSL clients." - explanation for why we used other curve in referenced Issue}
* Support and enable Ed25519 TLS certificates by default on Go 1.13 https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1477 {SB: something similar in Decrediton? Is it newsworthy this update to keep up with Go 1.13?}
* Add ticketbuyer.limit flag to limit max tickets bought per block. https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1476 {SB: seems like a potentially important change, but no description...}
* multi: use https links where available https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1489
* Generate new block locators after announced blocks https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1488 {SB: stab at summary (needs review) - Protects against possible race condition in SVP "by always
checking whether a new locator generation has zero length and if so,
new locators are generated and saved."
* Update dcrec, edwards, and chaincfg modules https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1485
* Remove direct usage of txscript.PayToAddrScript https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1484
* Prepare for wallet/v2.1.0 https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1480 {SB: this seems important? Is v2.1.0 important? No description in issue..}
* spv: Add SetPersistentPeers, deprecate SetPersistantPeers https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1466 {SB: no description, important?}
* Add SPV notifications for processed transactions and blocks. https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1465 {SB: sounds important, but no description of change}

Open

* multi: allow wallet unlocks via a passphrase token https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1465 {SB: we reported this work being started in the April issue. Issue update on progress? {SB: From DJ April: "Work started to add optional authentication for gRPC API, which allows users to omit the private passphrase in API calls that require an unlocked wallet. This will mitigate issues that arise when unlocked wallets are isolated via physical and networked segmentation."}
* Allow arbitrary xpub account imports.  https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1471 {SB: Perhaps important, but no activity since 22 days agoo...From description: "Addresses of imported xpub accounts are not watched and transactions are not saved. This may change later, but the purpose of this feature is to allow the automatic ticket buyer to derive unique voting addresses in sequence, avoiding address reuse."

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): 

Merged
* Refactor config.js https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2129

Open
* [ln] Initial Version https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2107

Work on embedding basic Lightning functionality (open/close channels, funding/withdrawing funds, create invoices, send payments) into Decrediton is nearing completion. {Is there any more we can say here? Expected release date (roughly)? Will this trigger another version bump (1.5.0?)}. Progress continues on refactoring Decrediton to use a finite state machine continues, along with minor UI tweaks and bug fixes.

* In response to a question about BTC-DCR swaps on LN, @matheusd [clarified](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/c17xxh/is_it_possible_to_exchange_btclightning_for/ere1skv/) the state of multiple elements of the puzzle.

## Governance

In June the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 15,135 DCR and spent 6,657 DCR. Using June's daily average DCR/USD rate of $28.90, this is $437K received and $192K spent. As these payments were for work completed in May, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the May average daily rate of $27.71 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $419K/$184K. As of July 1, Treasury balance is 622,472 DCR ($18.36 million USD at $29.50).

Commenters in the proposal and [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/buv18c/block_header_commitments_consensus_change_proposal/) appreciated how the proposal has sections for both technical and non technical audiences, and also noted how Decred's on-chain voting systems allows for elegant updates without years of fruitless discussions.

FATF has [finalized](https://www.coindesk.com/fatf-crypto-travel-rule) its recommendation for handling crypto. Per the new standards, businesses like exchanges and wallet providers must obtain and store information to identify both sender and recipient, and exchange this information with each other. Member countries have 12 months to adopt the guidelines which will be reviewed in June 2020. The recommendations are not binding but non-complying countries risk getting into a blacklist.

Some experts [warned](https://www.coindesk.com/beyond-kyc-global-regulators-appear-set-to-adopt-tough-new-rules-for-crypto-exchanges) FATF that the new standard "could have the unintended consequence of 'encouraging P2P transfers via non-custodial wallets...'" (which sounds strikingly familiar to the intended way of using crypto). Another quote from [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/regulators-begin-to-debate-cryptocurrency-legislation-ahead-of-g20-summit) on this possible dynamic: "a common concern is that new regulations could push the public out of controlled platforms".

Ad blocking browser extensions like uBlock are about to get hit by new Google Chrome [restrictions](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/06/13/google_chrome_ad_blockers/). The move triggered a lot of controversy, partly because the stated intent to protect the users from malicious extensions also restricts users' ability to block unwanted and dangerous web content.
