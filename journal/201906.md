{introduction, major news of the month ordered by impact}

## Development

{add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warranets a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): 

SB: lots of smaller looking PRs this mo, not sure what is important or if there's a larger theme here...

* certgen: Support Ed25519 cert generation on Go 1.13 {SB: update to support new version of go} https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1757
* edwards: Introduce v2 module.{SB: not sure what Edwards module is, is it important?} https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1762 

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

Merged

* curve https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1468
* rpc: explicitly specify immature & live tickets in StakePoolUserInfo https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1478 {SB: perhaps important: "This change explicitly states whether a ticket is immature or live rather than the previous implementation that grouped both immature & live tickets as live."}
* Switch default TLS elliptic curve from P-521 to P-256 https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1468 {SB: seems important? "P-256 is implemented in constant time while P-521 is not, making it more secure against side channel attacks. In addition, this curve has broader software support. In particular, P-521 is unusable from BoringSSL clients." - explanation for why we used other curve in referenced Issue}
* Support and enable Ed25519 TLS certificates by default on Go 1.13 https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1477 {SB: something similar in Decrediton? Is it newsworthy this update to keep up with Go 1.13?}
* Add ticketbuyer.limit flag to limit max tickets bought per block. https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1476 {SB: seems like a potentially important change, but no description...}
* multi: use https links where available https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1489
* Generate new block locators after announced blocks https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1488 {SB: stab at summary (needs review) - Protects against possible race condition in SVP "by always
checking whether a new locator generation28.90 has zero length and if so,
new locators are generated and saved."
* Update dcrec, edwards, and chaincfg modules https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1485
* Remove direct usage of txscript.PayToAddrScript https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1484
* Prepare for wallet/v2.1.0 https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1480 {SB: this seems important? Is v2.1.0 important? No description in issue..}
* spv: Add SetPersistentPeers, deprecate SetPersistantPeers https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1466 {SB: no description, important?}
* Add SPV notifications for processed transactions and blocks. https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1465 {SB: sounds important, but no description of change}

Open

* multi: allow wallet unlocks via a passphrase token https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1465 {SB: we reported this work being started in the April issue. Issue update on progress? {SB: From DJ April: "Work started to add optional authentication for gRPC API, which allows users to omit the private passphrase in API calls that require an unlocked wallet. This will mitigate issues that arise when unlocked wallets are isolated via physical and networked segmentation."}
* Allow arbitrary xpub account imports.  https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1471 {SB: Perhaps important, but no activity since 22 days agoo...From description: "Addresses of imported xpub accounts are not watched and transactions are not saved. This may change later, but the purpose of this feature is to allow the automatic ticket buyer to derive unique voting addresses in sequence, avoiding address reuse."

Work on embedding basic Lightning functionality (open/close channels, funding/withdrawing funds, create invoices, send payments) into Decrediton is nearing completion. {Is there any more we can say here? Expected release date (roughly)? Will this trigger another version bump (1.5.0?)}. Progress continues on refactoring Decrediton to use a finite state machine continues, along with minor UI tweaks and bug fixes.

Dev activity stats for June: 283 active PRs, 321 master commits, 62K added and 29K deleted lines spread across 15 repositories. Contributions came from 1-8 developers per repository. ([chart]({chart link is optional, drop if not ready}))

## People

Welcome to new first time contributors with code merged to master: Marton [politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia/commit/89b2b5a19d014d198a6d51a3429643a51b80d5b6), Amos Ezeme [dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/commit/b13e41c205b4568fd4a9ce81634308759e35638d), Quadri Anifowose [dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/commit/642a9fdd5ab8bdb39de0fec4f0b32bc798e0f041), Lore [dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/commit/642a9fdd5ab8bdb39de0fec4f0b32bc798e0f041)


## Governance

In June the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 15,135 DCR and spent 6,657 DCR. Using June's daily average DCR/USD rate of $28.90, this is $437K received and $192K spent. As these payments were for work completed in May, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the May average daily rate of $27.71 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $419K/$184K. As of Jul 1, Treasury balance is 622,472 DCR ($18.36 million USD at $29.50).

Below is the proposal status as of Jul 1.

The following proposals were approved:

* [Decred Bug Bounty Proposal: Phase 2](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/073694ed82d34b2bfff51e35220e8052ad4060899b23bc25791a9383375cae70)

* [Ditto Communications Proposal for Decred: Phase 2](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04)

* [Decred Open Source Research proposal: Phase 2](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f)

* [Decentralized Exchange Specification Document](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/a4f2a91c8589b2e5a955798d6c0f4f77f2eec13b62063c5f4102c21913dcaf32)

* [Block Header Commitments Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58). Commenters in the proposal and [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/buv18c/block_header_commitments_consensus_change_proposal/) appreciated how the proposal has sections for both technical and non technical audiences, and also noted how Decred's on-chain voting systems allows for elegant updates without years of fruitless discussions.

There were 2 new proposals published:

* [Supplemental Proposal For Decred Tutorials By Denni Lovejoy](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d8d7ff7ad138ed322422aaa4d2a3e1c61f296ae56a2c2316cc5ecd10cf8dd8bd). This proposal asks for the original budget of $750 for tutorial videos to be increased to $7,500. @Denni Lovejoy has asked for the proposal to be abandoned following comments opposing it. There is some ongoing discussion about how to handle these scenarios where work on a proposal goes significantly over budget.

* [Decred  Media Campaign Proposal - Crypto Economy - 2019/2020](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1a367dcb91b55c60ad5fd038b219201154fcab965edd7a4639f157e409b1f4bf). This proposal requested $33,600 to promote Decred in a number of ways, including banner advertisements , press releases, a Decred giveaway and a newsletter. Comments remarked that some of these are already being well covered and others are not desirable, the proposal was then abandoned by its owner.

Following [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bx00fu/so_about_the_exmo_exchange/) on Reddit, Exmo posted a short [update](https://twitter.com/Exmo_Com/status/1138020825137930240) and went on to list DCR on Jun 13.

A number of posts on the /r/decred subreddit have sought to poll the Decred community about the [optimal Politeia approval threshold](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bynidz/poll_optimal_politeia_pass_threshold/), [renaming Decrediton to Declaration](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/c4ilpw/poll_rename_decrediton_to_declaration/), considering whether it should be [called something other than a wallet](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/c52hqd/question_is_a_hybrid_finance_governance_tool/), and asking whether Decred should start [using DAO instead of DAE](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/c02geh/poll_rename_dae_to_dao/) to describe the decentralized stakeholder governance of the project.

The last one can be considered a "soft proposal" by @s_ben to stop using DAE (Decentralized Autonomous Entity) and start using DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) when describing the organization of the Decred project. The rationale was to position Decred approach as relevant to the DAO concept and one of the projects to watch in that space. There was strong support for 

@s_ben also asked this question in chats, and there appeared to be good support for the change (as captured in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/c02geh/poll_rename_dae_to_dao/er1g4px)). @s_ben then went ahead and opened Pull Requests to change the term in the limited number of places where it was being used in docs and on decred.org.

While some of these polls and the discussions around them have been interesting, there are problems with using reddit and polling sites to gauge the opinions of Decred stakeholders - these are open to people who are not stakeholders, and allow for the polls/posts to be arbitrarily deleted or modified by their creator. In discussion about this phenomenon there seems to be strong support for a Decred version of reddit, based on Politeia, which would allow for a limited number of ticket-voter polls to be created.


## Network

Hashrate: June's hashrate opened at ~504 Ph/s and closed ~540 Ph/s, bottoming at 369 Ph/s and peaking at 607 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate distribution as of Jul2: lab.antpool.com 18%, UUPool 17.7%, F2Pool 14%, Poolin 9.5%, BTC.com 9%, Luxor 2.2%, CoinMine 0.21%, BeePool 0.15%, suprnova 0.03% and others 29% per per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

{helpful for PoS: https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000003/proof-of-stake?orgId=1&from=1559381330622&to=1561886930623}

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 120 DCR (+4) per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 116.78-127.29 DCR. Locked amount was 4.75-4.83 million DCR, which corresponded to [49-48%](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000003/proof-of-stake?orgId=1&from=1559327400000&to=1561919400000) of the available supply.

Looking at node stats from [dcr.farm](ttps://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1559381330622&to=1561886930623). It shows an average of 426 nodes in the network,it also indicates that a large percentage of the network is on version 1.4.0.

Throughout May it shows a large variation in the count of v1.4.0 nodes (103-237), but it has a nice chart of node version history that gives a general idea that the network is mostly on v1.4.0+ now.


On June 27th decred supply crossed 10,000,000. [Raedahgroup](https://twitter.com/raedahgroup/status/1144655370234880000) made a tweet about it.

We got a few support requests from ticketholders saying that their tickets have been missed by certain VSPs. On investigation, we found that [Grassfed](https://dcr.grassfed.network/) and [d1pool](https://d1pool.com) have been forked off from the network and have missed on these votes. Grassfed has responded to us and has promised to keep up with future updates. We have been unable to reach d1pool and discussion is currently underway to remove them from the list of approved VSPs.

There has also been [dev](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/413) [talk](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$156207152510654HMiFp:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) on how we could avoid these issues in the future. We also has some discussions on plans to get people to setup their own [voting wallets](https://matrix.to/#/!dhHYPTtCtvPSUfTepT:decred.org/$156207972910815kERGq:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com).

## Integrations

Exmo exchange [delivered](https://exmo.com/en/news_view?id=2776) on their [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/950e8149e594b01c010c1199233ab11e82c9da39174ba375d286dc72bb0a54d7) and enabled  DCR/BTC, DCR/RUB, DCR/UAH pairs on their exchange. 

Vertbase exchange added both [recurring orders](https://twitter.com/vertbase/status/1141735926059716611) and an option to [Buy and Sell](https://twitter.com/vertbase/status/1141735926059716611) digital assets using their exchange.

EliteX [listed](https://twitter.com/elitexcrypto/status/1143044131800977409) Decred and also wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@elitexexchange/the-lowdown-on-decred-dcr-2a36520079f5) to explain decred to their users.

MXC Exchange [added](https://twitter.com/wanbihou/status/1143846271645437952) a DCR/USDT exchange pair.

Bleutrade announced DCR to be delisted among a mass cleanup on Jul 1 https://bleutrade.com/announcements/ https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/c86a75/bleutrade_will_delist_dcr_20190715_1500_utc/ (second cleanup this year)

{SB: makes sense to put this here, but I think it could also go in Governance section. Also, this text is just copied from the latest [pi digest](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-18-june-10-june-29-97d140569ad0), so maybe we want to reword a little}
Decred’s part of the Trust Wallet integration is nearing completion. Approved by voters in March, this [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ababdea7da2b3d8312a773d477272135a883ed772ba99cdf31eddb5f261d571) split work between the Trust Wallet team, which was tasked with the core wallet integration, and Decred, which was tasked with integrating with and hosting the Blockbook server Trust Wallet uses to host transaction data. Core wallet integration has been completed by Trust Wallet, and Decred’s Blockbook integration is [nearing completion](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook/pull/216)), with one final issue remaining regarding how to represent Decred’s unique PoS voting mechanism in Blockbook data.

Comm systems news:

* Several Matrix rooms were upgraded following the first stable release of Matrix spec. Users have to join new rooms but the process is very straightforward and all history is preserved.

Selected Reddit posts:

* A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/c60aho/governance_would_matrixlike_channel_discussions/) asking if Matrix-like channel discussions posted on Reddit would increase adoption & education. 
* [POLL: optimal Politeia pass threshold](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bynidz/poll_optimal_politeia_pass_threshold/) - 57% said current level is OK, 7% said less than 60%, 26% were in favor of increasing the approval threshold.
* [POLL: Rename Decrediton to Declaration](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/c4ilpw/poll_rename_decrediton_to_declaration/) - has a score on reddit of 0, which should probably be interpreted as lack of support.

Selected Twitter discussions:

More wild not-quite-maximalists were spotted on twitter this month, people who would consider themselves Bitcoiners but who also have a fondness for Decred. Apparently there are more of these closeted Decred fans, who dare not speak out about the cred because it would raise the ire of people in their circle.

* [@Ammarooni](https://twitter.com/Ammarooni/status/1145213941146181632) thread about how "Bitcoin is addressing structural shortcomings of fiat money that aren’t immediately visible to the naked eye, but will become prominent over time. Decred is addressing the shortcomings of Bitcoin that aren’t prevalent today, but may become manifested over time."
* @Checkmate tweeted a [thread](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1142918632546156544) about Dered as a digital organism driven by a human hive-mind with skin in the game, then went on to [compare](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1145944145141411840) its stock-to-flow with Bitcoin's and finally issue a [challenge](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1145764832362319872) to all Bitcoiners: spend one month studying Decred and come out believing it is not a worthy number 2 to Bitcoin.
* @CryptoBrekkie created an interesting poll which received 720 responses.

> So I've noticed a trend among some maximalists lately expressing a desire for a real, sound money competitor to Bitcoin, a rival that could ultimately help Bitcoin level up.
> I've also noticed many maximalists have a soft spot for [@decredproject](https://twitter.com/decredproject).
> Could Decred be that competitor?

36% said Yes, 52% said No. 

## Markets

In June DCR was trading between USD 24.77-37.06 / BTC 0.0026-0.0035. The average daily rate was $28.90.

On June 22nd Bitcoin crossed $10000 and in a matter of days rose up to $13670 in some markets. This caused most alts including Decred to do down in terms of BTC.

## Relevant External

Facebook published the [Libra white paper](https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/) on Jun 18, and this dominated blockchain news and discussion for a spell more than any other subject has for some time. Quotes from @jy-p were featured in a number of articles about Libra on high profile sites (see Ditto update), questioning Facebook's track record and whether inviting them to also handle our financial transactions is a good idea. We will not revisit the discussion of Libra here, except to note that the white paper addresses how it will be governed - through an association where validators (approved organizations that provide the necessary capital) vote to make decisions. 21 organizations, mostly large multinationals, were [announced](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/06/14/facebooks-cryptocurrency-partners-revealed-we-obtained-the-entire-list-of-inaugural-backers/) with the white paper, with an aim to have 100 signed up before Libra launches. It will be interesting to see how a distributed ledger operated by 100 (mega-)corporations behaves in comparison to the one operated by the Decred stakeholders and their ~40,960 tickets.

Dovey Wan [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/hard-core-fund-collects-50-btc-in-china-to-support-bitcoin-developers) that the 'Hard Code Fund' has accumulated 50 BTC which can be used to pay Bitcoin developers, and described the search for sustainable funding for Bitcoin developers as the biggest challenge facing the ecosystem in 2019. The fund makes payments to approved Bitcoin contributors when they send monthly reports about what they have worked on.

The Bitcoin Cash Development Fund also [announced](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-development-fund-receives-massive-support/) good progress on a development funding drive, with 760 BCH of a targeted 800 BCH raised from 900 donors.

Grin is attempting to [iterate](https://www.grin-forum.org/t/proposal-grin-governance-iteration/5191) towards a less centralized form of governance, after recognizing that the absence of formal governance processes plus the need for trusted contributors to manage shared resources (donated funds) has led to a de facto centralization of responsibility for the project. The grin council is to become the core team. A Request for Comment process is being introduced through which feedback is sought on proposed development work. Sub-teams will organize independently with their own leaders.

Zcash continues to move towards a method of funding development long-term through a portion of the block reward, likely 10%. Zooko (CEO of Electronic Coin Company) has [stated](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zooko-wilcox-gives-zcash-community-154140125.html) that the ECC needs 12 months of runway to function and if no continuation of funding for ECC is established one year before the founder's reward, then ECC will have to consider pivoting to other projects which can generate revenue. Zooko has also expressed the opinion that the ECC should not take the lead on deciding how this funding mechanism should work, and that it should be more decentralized than the current setup. Zooko has been [looking](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1137494548148416512) at Decred's governance as part of this process. 

Monero Community Crowdfunding System is [funding](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/RandomX-audit.html) 3 audits of the new PoW algorithm, following a [process](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/bozr0z/randomx_auditor_selection/) in which 20 participants in the #monero-dev IRC channel voted to prioritize the audits. A CCS proposal was created which covers all 3 audits (costing $18k, $47k and $53k respectively), with audits being greenlit as enough funds became available to pay for the preferred audits.

Aragon Black [published](https://blog.aragon.black/aragon-fundraising-the-return-of-the-commons/) an article about Aragon Fundraising, which will be coming to mainnet in a few months. This is a platform for conducting Decentralized Autonomous Initial Coin Offerings (DAICOs, a concept initially [described](https://ethresear.ch/t/explanation-of-daicos/465) by Vitalik Buterin). Individuals who invest in a DAICO will receive tokens which grant them voting rights and some degree of ownership of the DAO's assets (which may come to include tokenized rights to intellectual property).

MakerDAO will be [voting](https://blog.makerdao.com/multi-collateral-dai-collateral-types/) to determine the order in which 7 pre-selected assets will be proposed for review and ratification as part of the multi-collateral DAI upgrade.

Arthur Breitman, Tezos founder, published a [blog](https://medium.com/@arthurb/potential-design-for-a-simple-and-evolvable-on-chain-treasury-77cfe2176423) with a design for a "simple and evolvable on-chain treasury". As a starting point, he suggests that funds be collected in a 3-of-5 multisig contract where the signatures are controlled by reputable parties. From there, the treasury could evolve into a system with many participants where proposals are made on chain. Sounds familiar.

There has been some friction between the developer groups working on Tezos software. The OCamlPro team introduced a proposal to fix a security issue and reward themselves from inflation funding - at a time when the other developer teams had agreed to wait and inject a proposal at a later time. OCamlPro's 'early' [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/comments/by5xy8/proposal_for_amendment_brest_a/) means that the bakers will likely vote it down and thus it will take longer before the "real" proposal is submitted. OCamlPro [appeared](https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/comments/byqc9i/ocamlpro_what_is_the_real_motivation_behind/) to be feeling frozen out by the other teams, having submitted a bug report and failed to receive acknowledgment. Subsequently, Tezos commons published an [article](https://medium.com/tezoscommons/a-cautionary-tale-ocamlpro-65d692af09f8) which purportedly uncovers details of a plan by OCamlPro to fork the Tezos chain and capture part of the Tezos community and market capitalization - and speculates that the OCamlPro team are acting to destabilize the Tezos community ahead of this move.

An anonymous user claiming to be a current or former employee of Chainalysis participated in an AMA on /r/Bitcoin, subsequently deleted but archived [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/c4so58/i_am_a_current_or_former_employee_of_chainalysis/) (thanks [@fiach_dubh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/c4so58/i_am_a_current_or_former_employee_of_chainalysis/eryukx6)). The answers suggested that Bitcoin privacy techniques like coinjoin and wasabi wallet, and all of the coins with privacy features, were hated by Chainalysis, and did not see a bright future for blockchain forensic analysis.

FATF has [finalized](https://www.coindesk.com/fatf-crypto-travel-rule) its recommendation for handling crypto. Per the new standards, businesses like exchanges and wallet providers must obtain and store information to identify both sender and recipient, and exchange this information with each other. Member countries have 12 months to adopt the guidelines which will be reviewed in June 2020. The recommendations are not binding but non-complying countries risk being put on a blacklist.

Some experts [warned](https://www.coindesk.com/beyond-kyc-global-regulators-appear-set-to-adopt-tough-new-rules-for-crypto-exchanges) FATF that the new standard "could have the unintended consequence of 'encouraging P2P transfers via non-custodial wallets...'" (which sounds strikingly familiar to the intended way of using crypto). Another quote from [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/regulators-begin-to-debate-cryptocurrency-legislation-ahead-of-g20-summit) on this possible dynamic: "a common concern is that new regulations could push the public out of controlled platforms".

The recent spate of geofencing continued, with Bittrex [stopping](https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028996652) US customers from trading 32 assets (DCR unaffected), and Gate.io [restricting](https://www.gate.io/article/16909) 19 assets for US customers (including DCR). 

Binance is [stopping](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/14/binance-begins-to-restrict-us-customers/) service to US customers via their global binance.com site, while [announcing](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/346119082624540672/Binance-Announces-Partnership-with-BAM-to-Launch-US-Exchange) that they will launch a separate US-based service. 

Bancor is going to [block access](https://support.bancor.network/hc/en-us/articles/360029588431-US-Service-Restriction) for US users to its web application for exchanging assets.

The Indian government is [considering](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/indias-draft-bill-proposes-a-10-year-jail-sentence-for-using-cryptocurrencies/) a draft bill which would criminalize those who mine, hold, or transact with cryptocurrencies, with stiff penalties of up to 10 years in prison and fines amounting to 3 times the perpetrator's gains.

The Bitsane exchange, made famous by CNBC in a broadcast tutorial on how to buy XRP, [appears](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/06/28/cnbc-shilled-cryptocurrency-exchange-bitsane-pulls-exit-scam-on-246k-users/) to have pulled an exit scam and disappeared, along with the cryptoassets of any unfortunate users who were storing their crypto on the exchange.

A [vulnerability](https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2019-02/) in certain YubiKey products allowed an attacker to guess private keys.

Ad blocking browser extensions like uBlock are about to get hit by new Google Chrome [restrictions](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/06/13/google_chrome_ad_blockers/). The move was controversial, partly because the stated intent to protect users from malicious extensions also restricts their ability to block unwanted and dangerous web content.

The rate of SIM swapping attacks is [increasing](https://www.tonysheng.com/sim-swap), [educate yourself](https://medium.com/mycrypto/what-to-do-when-sim-swapping-happens-to-you-1367f296ef4d) and do what's necessary to protect your accounts.

Who would have thought that a 27-year old _text editor_ can still have an arbitrary code execution [vulnerability](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/06/12/vim_remote_command_execution_flaw/)? This is a reminder that correctness is hard and why it takes so much work to build and test robust software.
