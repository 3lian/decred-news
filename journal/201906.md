## Governance

In June the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {n} DCR and spent {n} DCR. Using June's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in May, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the May average daily rate of ${n.nn} - in which case the USD received/spent figures are ${n}K/${n}K. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {n} DCR ({n.nn} million USD at ${n.nn}).

India is proposing a 10-year jail sentence for those who mine, hold, or transact with cryptocurrencies. Ironically, the same bill proposes to create government-controlled Digital Rupee.

FATF has [finalized](https://www.coindesk.com/fatf-crypto-travel-rule) its recommendation for handling crypto. Per the new standards, businesses like exchanges and wallet providers must obtain and store information to identify both sender and recipient, and exchange this information with each other. Member countries have 12 months to adopt the guidelines which will be reviewed in June 2020. The recommendations are not binding but non-complying countries risk getting into a blacklist.

Some experts [warned](https://www.coindesk.com/beyond-kyc-global-regulators-appear-set-to-adopt-tough-new-rules-for-crypto-exchanges) FATF that the new standard "could have the unintended consequence of 'encouraging P2P transfers via non-custodial wallets...'" (which sounds strikingly familiar to the intended way of using crypto). Another quote from [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/regulators-begin-to-debate-cryptocurrency-legislation-ahead-of-g20-summit) on this possible dynamic: "a common concern is that new regulations could push the public out of controlled platforms".

Ad blocking browser extensions like uBlock are about to get hit by new Google Chrome [restrictions](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/06/13/google_chrome_ad_blockers/). The move triggered a lot of controversy, partly because the stated intent to protect the users from malicious extensions also restricts users' ability to block unwanted and dangerous web content.

The rate of SIM swapping attacks is [increasing](https://www.tonysheng.com/sim-swap) while phone numbers and email becomes a single point of failure.

Who would have thought that a 27-year old _text editor_ can still have an arbitrary code execution [vulnerability](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/06/12/vim_remote_command_execution_flaw/)? This is a reminder that correctness is hard and why it takes so much work to build and test robust software.
