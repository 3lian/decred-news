# Decred Journal â€“ December 2018

![Decred Journal - December 2018](../img/journal-201812-384.jpg "Decred Journal - December 2018")

December was a month of considerable progress. Politeia approved proposals are gaining momentum, with Ditto personnel joining the comms channels to work on messaging and plans for 2019 with the broader community.

Release candidates of core software v1.4.0 are available for download [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2). Enthusiasts are invited to try them while regular users are advised to wait for the final release. 

The [dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid) wallet for Android OS also saw its first release candidates available on the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet). 

Decred is set for continued expansion and acceleration through 2019. Happy New Year to all readers from the Decred Journal team!

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): v1.4.0 RC2 was released. This version includes the [smart fee estimator](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1434) that allows the user to either minimize mining delay or the fee, depending on needs. The [feature](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412) is important for Lightning Network and as a general mechanism to handle network congestion.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): v1.4.0 RC2 release fixes bugs related to SPV. More changes in the [release notes](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2).

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): v1.4.0 RC2 release features initial Trezor support, design improvements and many bug fixes. More details are in [release notes](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2).

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): latest [security tightening](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/935) earned Politeia an A+ rating from [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/?q=test-proposals.decred.org&followRedirects=on), which placed it in the site's top 3% and (briefly) in the Hall of Fame. 

In progress are admin [data backups](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/605) and two big changes to scale the server: [cache layer](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/546) and [websockets support](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/547).

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): v1.0.0 release candidate 2 is available on Google Play for [mainnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet) and [testnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.testnet). 

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): has mostly just been syncing up with the changes from Android. iOS testing releases will be made available as soon as Android 1.0 is done.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): v3.1.1 is released on the [main site](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/). Highlights include new pages for [sidechains](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/side) and [disapproved blocks](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/rejects), major performance improvements, Go modules support, non-javascript mode [improvements](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/852) _(thanks from an anti-js dinosaur!)_. See full release notes [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/releases/tag/v3.1.0). The release includes 129 commits from 4 months of work made by 16 code contributors. Congrats to dcrdata team!

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): [v0.7.0](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.7.0) and [v0.7.2](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.7.2) released. 

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): page headers were [changed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/457) from javascript to videos, Rocket.Chat [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/460) from the Community page, Decred Business Brief is now available as a [web page](https://decred.org/brief/) in addition to the PDF download.

Dev activity stats for December: 230 active PRs, 196 master commits, 33K added and 106K deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 3-9 developers per repository.

## People

Welcome to new first time contributors: [aerth](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits?author=aerth) (dcrwallet), [@guang](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits?author=Guang168) (decrediton) and [tpkeeper](https://github.com/decred/politeia/commits?author=tpkeeper) (politeia).

@richardred published an excellent [Working for the Decred DAE](https://medium.com/@richardred/working-for-the-decred-dae-a9cfb17686fa) post that describes his Decred journey in some detail.

Several independent contractors are preparing a community [roadmap document](https://github.com/degeri/decred_independent_contractor_roadmap) where they outline their plans for 2019.

## Governance

In December the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 17,016 DCR and spent 12,570 DCR. Using December's daily average DCR/USD rate of $17.5, this is $298K received and $220K spent. As these payments were for work completed in November, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the November average daily rate of $32.5 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $553K/$409K.

Here are short proposal updates as of Jan 10. Please do not rely on them to form your opinion about the proposals and read the original texts and discussions on [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/).

Detailed Politeia activity is provided by @richardred in Politeia Digest [issue 8](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-8-dec-5-dec-11-2018-23bb061a08a0) and [issue 9](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-9-dec-12-dec-31-2018-67b65b5bf30). 

## Network

Hashrate: December's hashrate opened at around 167 Ph/s and closed around 183 Ph/s, peaking at 207 Ph/s and bottoming at 110 Ph/s throughout the course of the month. For the most part, the average was 150 Ph/s. As of Jan 10, pool hashrate distribution: poolin 34%, F2pool 27%, UUPool 7.4%, btc.com 7%, Luxor 3.8%, BeePool 2.6%, coinmine 1.1%, others are 17% per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 103 DCR (+0) per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 101 DCR and 107 DCR. Locked amount was 4.14-4.23 million DCR, which corresponded to 46.3-47.1% of the available supply.

Nodes: As of Jan 1 there were 192 public listening nodes and 253 normal ones per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 1.5% are v1.5.0(pre) dev builds, 1.8% on v1.4.0(rc1), 5.3% on v1.4.0(pre) (-1.2%), 55% on v1.3.0 (+5%), 20% on v1.2.0 (-5%), 10% on v1.1.2 (-1%), 4% on v1.1.0 (-1%).

## Integrations

The hardware wallet company Ledger announced that the long-awaited DCR integration is complete:

> We are excited to announce that the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue are now compatible with Decred. Decred is now available on Ledger Live and marks the first native Ledger Live integration since its launch. Read more [here](https://www.ledger.fr/2018/12/11/ledger-nano-s-ledger-blue-and-ledger-live-now-support-decred-transactions/) ([@LedgerHQ](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/1072446149863329792))

Cobo Wallet [announced](https://twitter.com/cobo_wallet/status/1070805250376900609) a custodial staking service. Discussed [here](https://matrix.to/#/!kdpEDksmOMNrlMqffD:decred.org/$154413818735775gNTIq:decred.org).

## Outreach

> 
> Ditto began Work on messaging, which can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BCah1EKLHpwgkvVcWRWJTRC68iWeGPdbGSrhEw35XhU/edit). Continued input is always valued. Concurrently, we're working with the design team to integrate new messaging into the site and to expand the content with new pages further explaining important aspects of Decred.
> 
> Messaging should be agreed upon in January, and a work will begin on the website. A plan including events and other tactics will also be published in January. (@Dustorf)

@Dustorf, @jy-p and Ditto met in New York and posted a report [in chat](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154413732235771XIVBH:decred.org). 

Trey [published](https://medium.com/decred/decred-and-ditto-in-2019-c9063a6bca06) Ditto's big picture look at 2019 and the strategy for Decred. Following that a [survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/a7cul1/decred_and_ditto_in_2019_share_your_ideas/) was held on Reddit asking the community how would they describe Decred, what media do they read and how they think Decred should target developers.

Mid-December @liz_bagot gave the inaugural Ditto [Bi-Weekly Update](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154482468943386bBAIp:decred.org), and later summarized the work for December.

Now a total of 5 well-known community members have the rights to tweet via @decredproject Twitter account. You can read about how it works [here](https://medium.com/@richardred/working-for-the-decred-dae-a9cfb17686fa#bd70).

Comm systems news:

* @dhill shot down [a bug](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/pull/644) in matterbridge that blocked the relay of messages from Slack to other platforms. Please report any bridge issues you notice.
* #smart\_contracts channel was archived due to inactivity.
* Rocket.Chat is being [retired](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/460).

Prototype [community issue tracker](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues) was started to discuss actionable ideas in a more structured format. Any idea that benefits the project can be discussed. As of Jan 10 there are [73 issues](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues) like [article ideas](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/labels/article), [PR](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/labels/PR), [archiving](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/labels/archiving) and data preservation, or discussion of [communication platforms](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/labels/comms). For example, [this issue](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/54) captures a challenging task to find a good name for Decred's hybrid PoW/PoS consensus algorithm and lists all options suggested so far. You can subscribe to everything with the Watch button on top, or to individual issues with Subscribe button on the right panel. There is a popular belief that "GitHub is for developers" - this is not the case. Posting issues and comments and '+1' is no harder than using Reddit or chat and in fact multiple non-developers already contribute doing just that.

Reddit incident showed us another weakness in the platform. Multiple threads were started and spurred useful discussion, but were later removed by the author. This wasted the effort of all people who bothered to reply. The deleted threads were somewhat [resurrected](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/a6ywpj/deleted_threads_with_valuable_discussion/), but generally this incident shows an attack/sabotage vector: trigger the discussion and then delete the thread, wasting community's energy. Reddit has no defense from this as moderators cannot disallow users to delete their content. The event has led to a discussion of a [Reddit replacement](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/38) that could probably derive from Politeia.

For yet another time, a lot of strange Reddit activity was timed close to our major release. It is either an unusual amount of questions about less relevant issues, or "innocent" questions about trivial things, or something similar. All coming from accounts never seen before and that stay after the short interaction. This notice is to inform people who care about the project to watch out for weird activity that can sap project's, as well as your individual energy. Read [this chat](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$154531182347084ccYxu:decred.org) for more details.

## Markets

In December DCR was trading between USD 14.2-21.4 / BTC 0.0042-0.0058. The average daily rate was $17.5. A short price rise to USD 20.9 / BTC 0.0058 happened on volume increased to USD 5-6 million compared to USD 0.8-1.2 million on other days. Note that the trading volume data is not reliable, as noted below.

## Relevant External

Vertcoin (VTC) was the subject of a majority (51%) [attack](https://medium.com/coinmonks/vertcoin-vtc-is-currently-being-51-attacked-53ab633c08a4) (4 incidents) in which 22 reorgs and 15 double spends occurred, costing the victims around $100,000. This reaffirms the vulnerability of coins that are not the dominant use for their miners (GPU-mineable or ASIC-resistant, but also Bitcoin forks) to be attacked by miners who have appropriate hardware and no interest in the health of the blockchain. One of the impacts of these attacks is that the coin comes to be regarded as insecure, because it has failed in its purpose before. Anyone who is still willing to accept it may require a very high number of confirmations before confirming a transfer, making the coin slow to move.

The [Horizen](https://www.horizen.global/) (previously ZenCash) team lead recently announced a [strategic action](https://blog.zencash.com/re-strategic-actions-for-horizen-from-rolf-versluis/) to increase the Treasury block rewards from 10% to 20%, reducing the share of rewards for miners. After a 90% reduction in price, and significant reductions to staffing and other costs, it was felt that to cut costs any further would mean jeopardizing the project. As the Treasury system being developed by IOHK is still a [prototype](https://blog.zencash.com/dao-prototype/) not yet ready for use, the Horizen team felt the need to make a unilateral decision to change the block reward.

EOS block producer [began paying](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-node-offers-users-financial-rewards-for-votes-reignites-decentralization-debate) holders that voted for it.

The first round of voting on Aragon Governance Proposals (AGPs) has been [delayed](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-vote-delay-announcement/426) due to potential network instability around the Ethereum Constantinople hard fork - hopefully "blockchain down for maintenance" is not a problem Decred will encounter with Politeia. The CEO of Aragon Association [published](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-wishlist-and-blacklist/355) a blacklist and wishlist for proposals before proposal submissions opened. In the first proposal the AGP [process](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-1.md) itself was [approved](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote/) by 99.97% of the ANT that voted. In total 2.6% of all ANT tokens voted on the first proposal, from 45 unique addresses, with ~60% of ANT votes coming from one address. AGPs go through a review by the board of the Aragon Association, then a community review, before a 48 hour voting period opens.

2 million BTCP were mined via an exploit and went unnoticed for months until CoinMetrics [noticed](https://coinmetrics.io/bitcoin-private) that something is wrong with the supply. Developer team [posted](https://medium.com/@bitcoinprivate/official-statement-on-coinmetrics-report-6f1cef176c05) an official statement confirming the inflation exploit. The bug was merged on Jan 5 2018 together with a patch from a bounty hunter that disengaged after receiving the reward for his work. Just one missing line of code caused huge damage to the network's value proposition. We can learn a lot from this unfortunate experience: extensive test coverage, super critical review of consensus code, established reputation of developers working on mission critical parts, and having multiple implementations of the protocol are all very important to build a system we can trust money to.

There was an [attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/a9yji3/electrum_wallet_hacked_200_btc_stolen_so_far/) on Bitcoin's Electrum infrastructure. Someone started a lot of malicious Electrum servers that prompted the user to "upgrade" to a malware version and stole 200+ BTC. The Electrum model involves a network of servers that sit between clients and full nodes. Each client depends on the server they connect to, this compromises user privacy as the owners of those servers can infer which wallets the users own. If Electrum servers were compromised this would open up some additional attacks. Decred chose not to develop Electrum infrastructure but instead go straight for SPV based on client-side filters. This delayed the development of light clients, but the SPV mode now working in dcrwallet, Decrediton and drcandroid connects to full nodes directly and functions independently of any service provider, which enhances users' privacy as a result.

Security researchers [demonstrated](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9563-wallet_fail) multiple ways to hack most popular hardware wallets, if in physical possession of the device.

Latest exchanges trading volume report by [blockchaintransparency.org](https://www.blockchaintransparency.org/) concluded that of the coinmarketcap.com top 25 BTC pairs over 80% of volume is wash traded. Another unhappy finding is that the average project spent over $50,000 on listing fees. The report has spurred [the idea](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/34) to analyze the trading volume for DCR.

Coinbase [seeks](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-wants-to-own-buidl-trademark-filing-reveals) to own the term "BUIDL".

Many cryptocurrency services and projects [seem to be](https://twitter.com/tangleblog/status/1068094875533479937) owned or co-owned by just a handful of entities with banks at the top.

Several centralized exchanges [failed](https://www.ccn.com/several-exchanges-said-to-be-failing-bitcoin-ownership-event/) to serve withdrawals during the annual [Proof-of-Keys](https://www.proofofkeys.com/) event.

Slack accidently [blocked](https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/22/iran-sanctions-slack/) people who visited Iran before. Later Slack [apologized](https://slackhq.com/an-apology-and-an-update) for the incident and clarified the situation. But the signal is clear and not surprising: Slack Technologies is a ([venture funded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_Technologies)) U.S. corporation that complies with U.S. laws. In contrast, Matrix rooms can be federated over multiple servers, so even if some participating servers are shut down, servers in other jurisdictions can keep serving the chat and history.

There have been a [number](https://www.wsj.com/articles/layoffs-become-the-latest-thing-in-cryptocurrency-1544471449) [of](https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/01/09/cryptocurrency-shapeshift-layoffs/) [articles](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitmain-layoffs-2018-12) in December about layoffs in the cryptocurrency space (and some saying it's [not so bad](https://cointelegraph.com/news/better-than-corporations-layoffs-in-crypto-are-on-the-rise-still-lower-than-in-other-industries) relative to other sectors). For other projects with Treasuries, these are also hard times, as noted for Horizen above and can be seen in some Dash [community discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/ac9ca4/dash_nigeria_defunding_statement_and_path_forward/). We can thank the people who managed the Treasury in the pre-Politeia era for its healthy balance, this is the reason that Decred is still looking to expand its workforce while other projects contract. With DCR at $17.5 for December, that will likely be the first month where Treasury outgoings are greater than the incoming block rewards. Even if DCR/USD stays low for some time, the Treasury could maintain its current USD-equivalent spending for several years (rough estimate is 8) at this rate before cut-backs became necessary.

Amid the larger wave of layoffs in the crypto sphere, Bitmain [allegedly](https://cointelegraph.com/news/reports-bitmain-allegedly-fires-all-bch-developers-in-wave-of-redundancies) fired its entire staff of Bitcoin Cash developers, which included the Copernicus team.

[Copernicus](https://github.com/copernet/copernicus) is an implementation of the Bitcoin Cash protocol written in Go that utilizes btcsuite. The pre-release version of software was [announced](https://news.bitcoin.com/an-alternative-client-has-mined-bitcoin-cash-block-558847/) and mined its first block in December. On their website the authors [thank](https://www.copernicuscore.org/btcd.html) btcsuite developers for their work and acknowledge their contribution to the Bitcoin ecosystem. On the blog Copernicus team [noted](https://medium.com/@copernicusbit/the-copernicus-project-launched-the-pre-release-v0-0-6-dc572a924214) that the software "reorganizes and redesigns the software structure for the original client in order to make the structure more concise, reduce the learning difficulty for developers and increase diversity of clients to ensure safety of the entire BCH network".

Copernicus is not the first effort to diversify Bitcoin Cash's network that already had several C++, Rust and JavaScript implementations in development. In September, two other implementations of Bitcoin Cash written in Go were [unveiled](https://news.bitcoin.com/developers-unveil-two-new-bitcoin-cash-full-node-clients-written-in-go/). [Gocoin-cash](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCPC/gocoin-cash) comes from the creators of [counterparty.cash](http://counterparty.cash/) and is based on [gocoin](https://github.com/piotrnar/gocoin) (another full Bitcoin node implementation in Go). [bchd](https://github.com/gcash/bchd) in turn comes from OpenBazaar developer [Chris Pacia](https://github.com/cpacia). In the initial [announcement](https://www.yours.org/content/introducing-bchd-aee6a07feb00) of bchd Chris noted that btcsuite is "one of the best designed and well-written Bitcoin codebases" and explained that it allows to engage more developers and build new features faster, compared to C++ implementations. It also gave them the private client-side SPV "for free". The beta was [announced](https://medium.com/@bchd.cash/bchd-beta-release-46f89c677c47) in November - two months since forking from btcd the team grew to 9 contributors and implemented several improvements over btcd.

The relevance and good news for Decred here is that a lot more developers are looking at btcsuite codebase now, on which Decred is based and can benefit from.
