![Decred Journal - December 2018](../img/journal-201812-384.jpg "Decred Journal - December 2018")

December was a month of considerable progress. Politeia approved proposals are gaining momentum, with Ditto personnel joining the comms channels to work on messaging and plans for 2019 with the broader community.

Release candidates of core software v1.4.0 are available for download [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2). Enthusiasts are invited to try them while regular users are advised to wait for the final release. 

The [dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid) wallet for Android OS also saw its first release candidates available on the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet). 

Decred is set for continued expansion and acceleration through 2019. Happy New Year to all readers from the Decred Journal team!

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): v1.4.0 RC2 was released. This version includes the [smart fee estimator](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1434) that allows the user to either minimize mining delay or the fee, depending on needs. The [feature](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412) is important for Lightning Network and as a general mechanism to handle network congestion.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): v1.4.0 RC2 release features initial Trezor support, design improvements and many bug fixes. More details are in [release notes](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2).

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): latest [security tightening](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/935) earned Politeia an A+ rating from [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/?q=test-proposals.decred.org&followRedirects=on), which placed it in the site's top 3% and (briefly) in the Hall of Fame. 

In progress are admin [data backups](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/605) and two big changes to scale the server: [cache layer](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/546) and [websockets support](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/547).

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): v1.0.0 release candidate 2 is available on Google Play for [mainnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet) and [testnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.testnet). 

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): has mostly just been syncing up with the changes from Android. iOS testing releases will be made available as soon as Android 1.0 is done.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): v3.1.1 is released on the [main site](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/). Highlights include new pages for [sidechains](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/side) and [disapproved blocks](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/rejects), major performance improvements, Go modules support, non-javascript mode [improvements](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/852) _(thanks from an anti-js dinosaur!)_. See full release notes [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/releases/tag/v3.1.0). The release includes 129 commits from 4 months of work made by 16 code contributors. Congrats to dcrdata team! 

Dev activity stats for December: 230 active PRs, 196 master commits, 33K added and 106K deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 3-9 developers per repository.

## People

Welcome to new first time contributors: [aerth](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits?author=aerth) (dcrwallet), [@guang](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits?author=Guang168) (decrediton) and [tpkeeper](https://github.com/decred/politeia/commits?author=tpkeeper) (politeia).

@richardred published an excellent [Working for the Decred DAE](https://medium.com/@richardred/working-for-the-decred-dae-a9cfb17686fa) post that describes his Decred journey in some detail.

Several independent contractors are preparing a community [roadmap document](https://github.com/degeri/decred_independent_contractor_roadmap) where they outline their plans for 2019.

## Governance

In December the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 17,016 DCR and spent 12,570 DCR. Using December's daily average DCR/USD rate of $17.5, this is $298K received and $220K spent. As these payments were for work completed in November, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the November average daily rate of $32.5 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $553K/$409K.

Here are short proposal updates as of Jan 10. Please do not rely on them to form your opinion about the proposals and read the original texts and discussions on [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/).

Detailed Politeia activity is provided by @richardred in Politeia Digest [issue 8](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-8-dec-5-dec-11-2018-23bb061a08a0) and [issue 9](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-9-dec-12-dec-31-2018-67b65b5bf30). 

## Network

Hashrate: December's hashrate opened at around 167 Ph/s and closed around 183 Ph/s, peaking at 207 Ph/s and bottoming at 110 Ph/s throughout the course of the month.

## Outreach

> 
> Ditto began Work on messaging, which can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BCah1EKLHpwgkvVcWRWJTRC68iWeGPdbGSrhEw35XhU/edit). Continued input is always valued. Concurrently, we're working with the design team to integrate new messaging into the site and to expand the content with new pages further explaining important aspects of Decred.
> 
> Messaging should be agreed upon in January, and a work will begin on the website. A plan including events and other tactics will also be published in January. (@Dustorf)

@Dustorf, @jy-p and Ditto met in New York and posted a report [in chat](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154413732235771XIVBH:decred.org). 

Trey [published](https://medium.com/decred/decred-and-ditto-in-2019-c9063a6bca06) Ditto's big picture look at 2019 and the strategy for Decred. Following that a [survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/a7cul1/decred_and_ditto_in_2019_share_your_ideas/) was held on Reddit asking the community how would they describe Decred, what media do they read and how they think Decred should target developers.

Mid-December @liz_bagot gave the inaugural Ditto [Bi-Weekly Update](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154482468943386bBAIp:decred.org), and later summarized the work for December.

Now a total of 5 well-known community members have the rights to tweet via @decredproject Twitter account. You can read about how it works [here](https://medium.com/@richardred/working-for-the-decred-dae-a9cfb17686fa#bd70).
