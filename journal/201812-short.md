![Decred Journal - December 2018](../img/journal-201812-384.jpg "Decred Journal - December 2018")

December was a month of considerable progress, with developer activity, as always, in full swing. Politeia approved proposals are also gaining momentum, with Ditto personnel joining the comms channels to work on messaging and plans for 2019 with the broader community. The high points for the month in Decred:

Release candidates of core software v1.4.0 are available for download [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2). This software includes a smart fee estimator, a critical element to support Lightning Network. s](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2).

Mobile wallet progress is robust, with the release of Android  and testing for iOS. [dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): v1.0.0 release candidate 2 is available on Google Play for [mainnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet) and [testnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.testnet). (https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios) 

Ditto began PR work in earnest. Trey [published](https://medium.com/decred/decred-and-ditto-in-2019-c9063a6bca06) Ditto's big picture look at 2019 and the strategy for Decred. Following that a [survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/a7cul1/decred_and_ditto_in_2019_share_your_ideas/) was held on Reddit asking for community input on marketing. jy-p and Dustorf traveled to NYC to onboard Ditto and hold Decred's first NYC Meetup, and work has already begun on messaging.

Decred held major events in NYC, Mexico City, and Toronto, and will attend events in the coming months in Taipei, Singapore, Warsaw, Miami, Atlanta, Rio De Janiero, and Guadalajara. More details here.

December marked the major integrations of hardware wallet companies Ledger and Cobo. Decred is now available on Ledger Live and marks the first native Ledger Live integration since its launch.

Dev activity stats for December: 230 active PRs, 196 master commits, 33K added and 106K deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 3-9 developers per repository.


Several independent contractors are preparing a community [roadmap document](https://github.com/degeri/decred_independent_contractor_roadmap) where they outline their plans for 2019.


In December the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 17,016 DCR and spent 12,570 DCR. Using December's daily average DCR/USD rate of $17.5, this is $298K received and $220K spent. As these payments were for work completed in November, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the November average daily rate of $32.5 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $553K/$409K.

Here are short proposal updates as of Jan 10. Please do not rely on them to form your opinion about the proposals and read the original texts and discussions on [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/).
