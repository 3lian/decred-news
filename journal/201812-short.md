December was a month of considerable progress, with developer activity, as always, in full swing. Politeia approved proposals are also gaining momentum, with Ditto personnel joining the comms channels to work on messaging and plans for 2019 with the broader community. The high points for the month in Decred:

1. Release candidates of core software v1.4.0 are available for download [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2). This software includes a smart fee estimator, a critical element to support Lightning Network.
1. Mobile wallet progress is robust, with the release of Android and testing for iOS. [dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): v1.0.0 release candidate 2 is available on Google Play for [mainnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet) and [testnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.testnet).

1. Ditto began PR work in earnest. Trey [published](https://medium.com/decred/decred-and-ditto-in-2019-c9063a6bca06) Ditto's big picture look at 2019 and the strategy for Decred. Following that a [survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/a7cul1/decred_and_ditto_in_2019_share_your_ideas/) was held on Reddit asking for community input on marketing. jy-p and Dustorf traveled to NYC to onboard Ditto and hold Decred's first NYC Meetup, and work has already begun on messaging.
1. Decred held major events in NYC, Mexico City, and Toronto, and will attend events in the coming months in Taipei, Singapore, Warsaw, Miami, Atlanta, Rio de Janeiro, and Guadalajara. More details here. {link}
