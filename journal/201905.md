## Development

{add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warranets a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): {}

Merged:
* wire: Add tests for MsgCFHeaders.https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1732 (simple test added..?)
* rpctest: Allow custom miner on voting wallet: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1751 (significant to end user or just speeding up simnet for devs?)
* TravisCI: Disable race detector.: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1749 (optional feature to speed up testing)
* peer: Prevent last block height going backwards.https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1747 (can't parse. bug fix?)
* wire: Add tests for MsgCFHeaders.: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1732

Open:
* blockchain: update CalcBlockSubsidy.: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1750 (performance optimization?)
* May saw a major optimization for PoW miners, with an [overhaul](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1748) of the background template generator (the function that miners call to receive templates to create blocks from). Currently, new miners not familiar with the intricacies of Decred voting will occasionally produce valid blocks with the minimum 3 votes from PoS voters (out of a possible 5). This is bad for PoW miners, who get a reduced subsidy for including fewer votes. This is also undesirable for PoS stakers, who may not receive the PoS reward, despite having voted, simply due to propagation delay. To address this, the background template generator has been updated to add support for intelligent vote propagation, as well as a number of other features, such as better handling of chain reorganization to alternative blocks, a subscription that provides miners a stream of template updates, and consideration of the synchronization state as part of determining if the chain is current. It should be noted that this work only implements the infrastructure and does not yet expose this functionality in production.  (this is potentially the biggest update, so have taken a stab at rewording davecgh's long commit message)
* mining: require a valid template address: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1739 (minor update, not sure if relevant)
* mining: require a valid template address: https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1736 (looks related to larger change above)
* rpcserver: refactor listener logic to server. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1734 (port from btcd, might be notable)
* blockmanager: remove serverPeer from blockmanager completely.https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1735 (port from btcd, might be notable)
* rpcserver: don't use activeNetParams. https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1733 (port from btcd, might be notable)
* connmgr: Add DialContext API https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1729 (not sure if important)


[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): {}

Merged:
* Add context to RPC method handlers: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1457 (important?)
* Return early with context error from spv rescan. https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1456 (bug fix) 
* Require ticket price limit configs to be non-zero to apply: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1454 (bug fix)
* Add errors.Cause to find inital cause of error: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1453 (meta bug fixing? i.e. bug feature?)
* Lock selected previous outputs for concurrent UTXO selection: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1452 (possibly important??)
* Replace wallet locking management goroutine with mutexes: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1451 (possibly a relevant feature we should describe in high-level terms that make sense to user)
* Bump to wallet/v1.2.3: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1449 (just looks like changing the version numbers, but do we have an actual minor version bump to announce?)
* Fix cursor indexes to derive next address: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1447 (bug fix)

Open:
* multi: allow wallet unlocks via a passphrase token: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1437 (opened Apr 24th, not sure if we covered already? remember similar feature added last mo)
* wip: add CleanOutAccount: https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1419 (seems like interesting new feature, WIP tho, not sure exactly the significance to the user)

LND: {}

Work continues to ready LND for mainnet, with bug fixes, improvements to integration tests to make them more stable and [run faster](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/32) on simnet, increased test coverage, and removal of unused code and references to BTC/LTC. Work has begun to [port](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/issues/12) Docker-related dcrlnd files to dcrlnd to enable easier tinkering and development by the community, and a [quickstart guide](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/8) has been started for knowledgeable individuals that want to
get going faster. Work has also begun to start porting [upstream changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/36) made to [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) since dcrlnd branched off to begin the initial port. 

dcrlnd has been added to the [Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.decred.org/) on an experimental basis, with [caveats](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd#security).

## Governance

In May the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 15,616 DCR and spent 8,456 DCR. Using May's daily average DCR/USD rate of $27.71, this is $433K received and $234K spent. As these payments were for work completed in April, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the April average daily rate of $24.22 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $378K/$205K. As of 1 Jun, Treasury balance is 613,840 DCR (17.3 million USD at $28.19).

Below is the proposal status as of Jun 1:

## Outreach
Decred was intensely busy in May laying the groundwork for a more decentralized operational rollout. Much of the work in May was focused in and around NYC Blockchain Week, where approximately fifteen community members got together with an extended group of exchanges, miners, institutional partners, and more. An Africa Telegram group (Decred Africa) was launched and coordinated a presentation at Blockchain Nigeria is Lagos on May 24th. In NYC, various community members attended the Magical Crypto Conference May 10-11, then Consensus the following three days. At Consensus, Jake presented a 30 minute update on Decred's funding and roadmap at their Changelogs track. Additionally, Jake spoke later that day at Ditto PR & The Block's first ever conference, AtomicSwap. Jake was on a panel with Beam, DASH and Orbs, and debated decentralization and governance with the other representatives. Decred coordinated a dinner with members of its Asian community and determined a strategy to penetrate the Asian market, prioritizing China in the immediate term. Dominic and Hugo are planning an event in partnership with Blockbeats, a major crypto media player, to promote and host a meetup in Beijing in the near future.

Anshawblack traveled to New York for NYC Blockchain week and recorded podcasts with JZ, Murad Madhudov, Joel Monegro, Luke Powell, Jamie Holdstock, and Permabull Nino. The first podcast with JZ will release June 1st, with others to follow.

Dustin released the first part of the Decred Assembly, a segment titled 'Decred Distributed' that looks at markets across the world and talks with local community organizers to understand what Decred is doing in those areas. The first edition featured Elian Huesca, who is leading efforts in Mexico and doing a lot of great work in Latin America. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7GYD8zwOe8 In early June, multiple additional segments will be released, including an in-depth discussion with jy-p about the DEX proposal.

Intel Speculative execution multiple vulnerabilities
<https://www.extremetech.com/computing/291474-intel-discloses-new-speculative-execution-security-vulnerabilities>

EOS Block Producers [burned](https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/bm75ih/the_mainnet_34m_eos_accumulated_4_inflation_is/) 34 million EOS (~$272 million) from the eosio.saving account. These funds had accumulated from the 4% inflation which was to be used to fund project development through a [Worker Proposal System](https://medium.com/eosys/eos-worker-proposal-system-announcement-6addcfb0134c). This idea fell out of favor with the EOS BPs and community, and 15 BPs supported the proposal to burn accumulated savings [on](https://www.eosx.io/tx/26ca16319febafc0942a8c6e3be26c16b84846b7cfe5f6ade906a0b86a6c2bb7?listView=actions) May 8. New tokens are still accumulating in the savings account, but this seems likely to be removed as there is an open [referendum](https://eosauthority.com/polls_details?proposal=inflation_20190307&prev=search) to remove the 4% inflation for development entirely, which has almost unanimous support from around 2.7% of EOS tokens that have voted.

Zooko [commented](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/the-future-of-zcash-in-the-year-2020/32372/173) on a long-running discussion about the future of Zcash development to express support for a new dev fund. Zcash currently allocates 20% of the block rewards to a founders reward but this is due to end some time in 2020. Zooko and many other advocates think the new dev fund needs to be more decentralized than the current setup of relying on the Electronic Coin Company.

Tezos Athens upgrade [activated](https://www.coindesk.com/in-first-tezos-blockchain-activates-upgrade-by-token-holder-voting) on May 30, marking the end of a process that began in February to select a proposal, endorse it, test it and activate it. One of the lesser discussed aspects of the protocol upgrade was the [generation](https://twitter.com/wisercharlie/status/1134240285238501376) of 100 new XTZ to be claimed by the upgrade's developers for a round of drinks. This has been described as a method of [funding development](https://medium.com/tocqueville-group/why-tezos-is-the-best-platform-for-tokenized-assets-89a960cfa828) in future, with the developers who make a protocol change proposal incorporating the generation of new XTZ which they can claim as a reward for their work.

Dash [Ventures](https://blog.dash.org/introducing-the-dash-investment-foundation-370cafcc48ee) investment foundation is nearing completion, and Dash will be holding an election to select a set of supervisors to oversee its operation. The Dash Investment Foundation will be able to take ownership of equity or other assets in consideration for network funding. The election to fill the remaining 4 of 6 supervisor seats [started](https://blog.dash.org/details-on-the-election-for-dash-investment-foundation-supervisors-25766c55a1f) on May 30, and will be followed by budgetary proposals to fund the foundation's administrative costs and allocate some capital for it to invest,

The [Open Money Initiative](https://medium.com/@openmoneyinitiative/announcing-the-open-money-initiative-61422b58ad06) was announced, a research nonprofit which will study how money is used in closed economies with collapsing monetary systems. The initiative's first project is an ethnographic study in Venezuela. The initiative is supported by funding from Zcash, Stellar, Tezos and the Cosmos supported Interchain Foundation - among others.

A Bitcoin Cash hard fork on May 15 was beset by [several](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-bitcoin-cash-hardfork-three-interrelated-incidents/) issues and in the ensuing chaos 3,391 BCH (~$1.35 million) were double spent. A bug with Bitcoin ABC led to invalid transactions filling up the mempool and a series of empty blocks being mined. Some miners began mining blocks on the pre-hardfork chain, causing a chain split. Immediately after the bug was resolved, a 2 block reorg occurred in which funds that the hardfork made spendable by any miners were double spent. It seems likely the dominant BCH miners reorged the chain to remove transactions in which these coins were claimed by another miner.

Poloniex has been busy in May, delisting [Peercoin](https://talk.peercoin.net/t/team-update-28-poloniex-delisting-legal-risks-memo-exchange-expansion-plans/9278) and a number of other cryptocurrencies, "[geofencing](https://medium.com/circle-trader/poloniex-to-stop-offering-trading-of-9-assets-to-us-customers-all-assets-remain-available-to-b4c5703c0e9)" DCR and 8 other cryptocurrencies so that US-based customers cannot trade it, and   [announcing](https://medium.com/circle-trader/cosmos-atom-staking-is-coming-to-poloniex-d587d6c6615d) support for Cosmos staking. The decision to geofence DCR on the basis of regulatory uncertainty is perplexing, given the many [reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ahuawl/decred_launch_security_laws/eeiaa0n/) why DCR should not be considered a security and concurrent support for ICO projects that seem more likely to be deemed securities. In a follow up [post](https://blog.circle.com/2019/05/20/us-crypto-policy-needs-to-change/), Circle CEO explained that the move is triggered by the [recent guidance](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets) from the SEC. Notably, the linked page says "This framework represents Staff views and is not a rule, regulation, or statement of the Commission.  The Commission has neither approved nor disapproved its content. This framework, like other Staff guidance, is not binding on the Divisions or the Commission.". Another [post](https://blog.circle.com/2019/05/23/our-take-interpreting-recent-signals-from-us-regulatory-agencies/) from Circle further elaborated on their position and complained about the difficulties caused by uncertainty from US regulators.

* mentioned in https://twitter.com/ResearchCircle/status/1126928932480126976
* paying miners to reorg the chain was discussed as a possible countermeasure against theft https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin/status/1125919526485254144
* reorgs covered here https://research.circle.com/weekly-recaps/weekly-crypto-recap-to-reorg-or-not-to-reorg
* reorg approach was eventually decided against to avoid damaging Bitcoin's credibility and avoid the risk of network or community split https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1125996194734399488

Another [sad story](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-most-expensive-lesson-of-my-life-details-of-sim-port-hack-35de11517124) surfaced of a person's poor security practices leading to a loss of >$100K in crypto. Hint: SMS 2FA is insecure and of course, don't keep that much on an exchange.

Firefox users went through a frustrating experience of software that worked yesterday suddenly stopped working. Most Firefox addons were disabled around May 3 due to an (unexpected?) expiration of code signing certificate, a bug dubbed ['armagadd-on-2.0'](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1548973). This included addons that protect user privacy and security by blocking tons of unwanted ad and spyware content on the web. Mozilla published a [notice](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/) that as a part of the solution, a "fix will be automatically applied in the background" delivered via the Studies system while a more general fix is in the works.
