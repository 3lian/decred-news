## Development

{ hint: add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- `schnorr`: improvements to safety, testing and performance, as well as a comprehensive [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/dcrec/secp256k1/schnorr/README.md) describing the custom Schnorr-based signature scheme used in Decred
- more places of the codebase migrated from Go's standard big integers to specialized field types

{ meta: what is the idea behind focusing on schnorr recently? is it for the treasury work? }

Lots of optimizations made in dcrd made over the past months have led to a "suffering from success" [meme](https://twitter.com/degeri_crypto/status/1248522626210897921): older nodes now think the new version is requesting too much data too quickly and banning it. The "banning rate" parameters will have to be adjusted to reflect the new speeds. { which specific change this was triggered by? and where is the change adjusting the ban rate? }

In progress:

- Decentralize Treasury Spending [development](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2170) work was published to make it more visible and let more people join the discussion. The work is based on the the [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) but adds significant changes to the spec. { it mentions changes to the spec, is that spec available anywhere? }

## Governance

In April the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 13,250 DCR and spent 17,228 DCR. Using April's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. At March's average daily rate of $13.40, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $231K. As of May 3, Treasury balance is 636,000 DCR (9.17 million USD at $14.42).

Two new proposals were submitted in April, [one](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bce7bf3cd1f74d571d23ac8a330ddf29a14a547ed0cc9c995f1a97dce733d1e1	) for a billboard marketing campaign was rejected with 17% approval (31% turnout) and [another](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/83b59ef5ab40193a86073abbd93cea13ed6d071eecc78918ab5cf98cba7c7a67	) from CryptoNoticias for a content marketing campaign was also rejected with 31% approval and 30% turnout.

The two proposals from March voted on this month were also rejected. DCR [Comic](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2f08f8518bc7672069a10ac6461fd9ab341d4a9e4c343fd4a7ec426250f3896f	) 2 had support from 49.4% of the tickets that voted (participation of 19%), while the Decred Daily [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/7d42c6f4bf3059b64789185af615c1df97cb61a379425933be5ff01d074ed4d5	) had 44% approval from the 17% of eligible tickets that voted.

## Network

{ hint:

- check dcrdata.org (preferred), dcrstats.com and charts.dcr.farm to get the numbers
- use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

Hashrate: [April's hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month. Pool [hashrate distribution](https://dcrstats.com/pow) as of {date}: {pool name n%, ...}. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was {n.n, try to snapshot it on 1st} DCR (+{n.n}). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&bin=window&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=k73pwcch-k8jayo3s&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, which corresponded to {n.n}-{n.n}% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=k73pwcch-k8jayo3s&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.

{ hint: second source for locked %: https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000003/proof-of-stake?orgId=1&from=now-40d&to=now }

{recap of ticket price action if it was interesting}

{ hint: consider keeping Block size and Transactions sections every 2nd or 3rd month, unless there is something interesting to report }

Block size: This month, the blockchain size grew by {n} MB. [Block size](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=block-size&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.n}-{n.n} with an average of {n.n} KB. {any interesting fact about this month's blocks}

Transactions: In April, Decred users made {n} regular transactions and bought {n} tickets. {n} tickets were rewarded for voting and {n} were revoked. On average, there were {n} regular DCR transactions and {n} new tickets per day.

{ hint: for dcr.farm set the zoom to show exactly UTC month 1st 00:00:00 - next month 1st 00:00:00 }

Nodes: Throughout [April](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1585699200000&to=1588291200000) there was an average of {} public listening nodes and {} total nodes per dcr.farm. Version distribution: {vx.y.z: n% (+n%), ...}.
