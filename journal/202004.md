## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- `schnorr`: improvements to safety, testing and performance, as well as a comprehensive [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/dcrec/secp256k1/schnorr/README.md) describing the custom Schnorr-based signature scheme used in Decred
- more parts of the codebase migrated from Go's standard big integers to specialized field types, making significant performance improvements

{ meta: what is the idea behind focusing on schnorr recently? is it for the treasury work? }

Lots of optimizations in dcrd made over the past months have led to a "suffering from success" [meme](https://twitter.com/degeri_crypto/status/1248522626210897921): older nodes now think the new version is requesting too much data too quickly and [banning](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$158650272611269MJQhM:decred.org) it. The "banning rate" parameters will have to be adjusted to reflect the new speeds.

{ any perf numbers to present are welcome, like % changes, IBD times, etc }

{ any comment on "unforking" dcrd/dcrwallet from btc/btcwallet is welcome }

In progress:

- Decentralize Treasury Spending [development](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2170) work was published to make it more visible and let more people join the discussion. The work is based on the the [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) but adds significant changes to the spec. { it mentions changes to the spec, is that spec available anywhere? }

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- new [`addtransaction`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1712) command that will be particularly useful for the upcoming ticket-based VSP design

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- [first](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2448) [steps](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2449) to migrate to functional components (a newer [approach](https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/react-functional-components/) in the React framework - they are easier to reason about and test)
- new action to [abandon transaction](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2467) that are not being mined or got "stuck"

- normalized and added [caching](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1844) for paywall data

## Governance

In April the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 13,250 DCR and spent 17,228 DCR. Using April's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. At March's average daily rate of $13.40, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $231K. As of May 3, Treasury balance is 636,000 DCR (9.17 million USD at $14.42).

Two new proposals were submitted in April, [one](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bce7bf3cd1f74d571d23ac8a330ddf29a14a547ed0cc9c995f1a97dce733d1e1	) for a billboard marketing campaign was rejected with 17% approval (31% turnout) and [another](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/83b59ef5ab40193a86073abbd93cea13ed6d071eecc78918ab5cf98cba7c7a67	) from CryptoNoticias for a content marketing campaign was also rejected with 31% approval and 30% turnout.

The two proposals from March voted on this month were also rejected. DCR [Comic](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2f08f8518bc7672069a10ac6461fd9ab341d4a9e4c343fd4a7ec426250f3896f	) 2 had support from 49.4% of the tickets that voted (participation of 19%), while the Decred Daily [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/7d42c6f4bf3059b64789185af615c1df97cb61a379425933be5ff01d074ed4d5	) had 44% approval from the 17% of eligible tickets that voted.

Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was 137.82 DCR (-4.08). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=k8gg8atj-k9ml7n4w&scale=linear&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) varied between 142.8-131.7 DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=k8gizzc5-k9mohzcd&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time&visibility=true-false) was 5.62-5.71 million DCR, which corresponded to 49.2-50.3% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=k8gjtr97-k9mpcc5p&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time&visibility=true-false) in PoS.

{recap of ticket price action if it was interesting}

{ hint: consider keeping Block size and Transactions sections every 2nd or 3rd month, unless there is something interesting to report }

Block size: This month, the blockchain size grew by 112 MB. [Block size](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=block-size&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.n}-{n.n} with an average of {n.n} KB. {any interesting fact about this month's blocks}

Transactions: In April, Decred users made {n} regular transactions and bought {n} tickets. {n} tickets were rewarded for voting and {n} were revoked. On average, there were {n} regular DCR transactions and {n} new tickets per day.

{ hint: for dcr.farm set the zoom to show exactly UTC month 1st 00:00:00 - next month 1st 00:00:00 }

Nodes: Throughout [April](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1585692000000&to=1588283999000) there was an average of 131 public listening nodes and 206 total nodes per dcr.farm.  Average version distribution for Apr: 38% dcrd v1.5.1, 13.6% dcrd v1.5, 5.1% dcrd v1.6 dev builds, 4.6% dcrd v1.4, 4.6% dcrd v1.5 dev and RC builds, 7.6% dcrwallet v1.5.1, 3.8% dcrwallet v1.4, 2.9% dcrwallet v1.5.
