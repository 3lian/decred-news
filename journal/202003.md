## Markets

In March DCR was trading between USD {n.nn}-{n.nn} / BTC {}-{}. The average daily rate was ${n.nn}.

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

On Mar 7 BTC/USD started its decline from $9,100 mark down to $7,800 on Mar 11. Following the global stock market crash and the wave of coronavirus panic on that week, BTC/USD tanked on Mar 12 with a bottom of ~$5,600. Most cryptoassets lost around 30% that day, demonstrating their persisting dependence on BTC and the mostly speculative price levels. This dump took DCR/USD with it down to $10.8. {update numbers}
