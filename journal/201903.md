GitHub policy update, sanctions and export laws {dig the new restrictions}

* https://github.blog/2019-03-14-githubs-site-policy-updates-are-ready-for-your-feedback/
* unlike most companies, GitHub has all their policy documents versioned transparently in a Git repo that anybody can clone and inspect. Pending changes are in open pull requests: https://github.com/github/site-policy/pulls
* Open to feedback until Apr 12, effective Apr 19
* "visitors and residents of jurisdictions that are subject to U.S. sanctions "are prohibited from using IP proxies, VPNs, or other methods to disguise their location when accessing GitHub services and may only use GitHub for non-commercial, personal communications." https://github.com/github/site-policy/pull/157/commits/c16de92e373612538731a10810f3c525dbb73df7
* GitHub now responds to DNT
* updates on the use of third party user tracking services
* more Google Analytics cookies https://github.com/github/site-policy/pull/154
* For Decred this means result in restrictions on accepting contributions from people in countries sanctioned by the U.S. {correct? https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/125}
* while unpleasant, the move is pretty common for a service that provides "free" services. Good moment to reflect on our beliefs about free stuff.
