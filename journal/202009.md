## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

The decentralize treasury spending [pull request](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2170) is [merged](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1308125042149134336) to master. It got 576 review comments, changed 115 files, added 15K lines of code, and took 5 months since the first draft was published. Thanks to everyone for the hard work on this complex change!

DCP0006 describing the treasury consensus change is under [review](https://github.com/decred/dcps/pull/17).

Follow-up treasury work:

- one-way [migration](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2336) of the database to support the new treasury implementation
- [tracking](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2350) of tspend (treasury spend) transactions in the mempool
- new peer messages to [relay](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2349) tspend transactions as nodes startup (this is to help both mining nodes and the voting wallets discover tspends in a timely manner)
- new RPC command to [tally](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2351) the vote count of tspend transactions (initially, only non-mempool mined tspends are queried)
- removed [footguns](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2389) from code for calculating treasury spend window values
- reworked [consistency](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2394) in the `standalone` package and brought the test coverage back to 100%

Other merged work:

- optimized signature [cache](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2358) to proactively evict entries related to transactions in a block that is already 2 blocks deep
- consolidated ban [disable/whitelist](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2363) logic
- more restrictive systemd service [privileges](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2357)
- updated [checkpoints](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2370) and min known [chain work](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2371) for the upcoming release
- dependency updates to prepare for the release
- lots of smaller improvements in test coverage, logging, error handling, etc

- Monero and Decred are the new Bitcoin by John Dennehy ([medium](https://medium.com/@john_dennehy/monero-and-decred-are-the-new-bitcoin-34a8c1fb2515))

> Since decentralization is a founding principle of the crypto-space it gets a lot of lip-service but one of the oldest problems with power is that it is extremely rare that once someone has it, they will give it up voluntarily. Decred is a rare exception and notable in the progress its developers have made in converting the projects resources into this autonomous system. Monero is another outlier here, as its development is completely funded by community donations.
