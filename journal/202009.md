- Monero and Decred are the new Bitcoin by John Dennehy ([medium](https://medium.com/@john_dennehy/monero-and-decred-are-the-new-bitcoin-34a8c1fb2515))

> Since decentralization is a founding principle of the crypto-space it gets a lot of lip-service but one of the oldest problems with power is that it is extremely rare that once someone has it, they will give it up voluntarily. Decred is a rare exception and notable in the progress its developers have made in converting the projects resources into this autonomous system. Monero is another outlier here, as its development is completely funded by community donations.
