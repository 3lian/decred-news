## Outreach

Outreach in December features RC 1.5.0, which featured Dave Collins educating about consensus changes on both [Decred Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQuY0kOt7g) and [Decred in Depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1527JwkDrs). The additional [Decred in Depth episode featured Matheus Degiovani on Lightning Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZeqrQpf-aU). The copy for the new website was put into GitHub and submitted to the Web_Ops team in Matrix for assembly. The new site is expected to publish in January.

Much of the rest of the month focused on reflection, discussion, and planning for 2020. [@bee published his thoughts here](), which prompted vigorous discussion in #Proposals, as Ditto and Dustorf look to prepare their next proposals. Dustorf followed up with [a survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-9JRDSMFS7/) soliticing community input on priorities regarding geographies, market segments, and possible applications. He will also publish a summary of marketing expenditures prior to his next proposal. 

Ditto is collecting ideas for their 3rd PR proposal https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$157609160161317ZZSti:decred.org

## Events

Attended:

- Nov 6 - [Bitcoin & Blockchains Meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/1444182132424731/) - Oaxaca, Mexico. @evok3d represented Decred. ([photos](https://twitter.com/ev0k3d/status/1192945388329807874), _missed in Nov_)
- Dec 4 - [Decred Demo](https://www.meetup.com/blockchaincentre/events/266659342/) - Melbourne, Australia. @eSizeDave and @zohand were invited to present Decred at Blockchain Centre's newly introduced Talk & Trade format. The demo of Politeia and Decrediton was expected to take 30 minutes but the total time surpassed 1.5 hours, which allowed to talk about key aspects of Decred and have a debate among the ~20 participants. ([report](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20191204-blockchain-centre-talk-and-trade-melbourne-australia.md))
- Dec 7 - Blockchain Communities Meetup - Mexico City, Mexico. Organized by Blockchain Bajio at Bitcoin Embassy Bar. (photos: [1](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1204144823231488000), [2](https://twitter.com/BlockchainBajio/status/1209141039086362624), [3](https://twitter.com/NancyNSalazar/status/1209143989984808961))
- Dec 12-13 - [Labitconf](https://www.labitconf.com/) - Montevideo, Uruguay. A team of 7 Decred Latam ambassadors presented the project during 2 days of the event. Previous efforts to build awareness in Latam became evident as many projects attending the event knew about Decred. Having no booth in a single place allowed the team to be everywhere, and they suggest to consider this approach for events of this size (~1000 visitors). Check the [full report](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20191212-labitconf-montevideo-uruguay.md) for notable interactions and other details.
- Dec 15 - [Crypto & Christmas](https://www.meetup.com/blockchaincentre/events/267037974/) - Melbourne, Australia. Decred Australia organized a party together with Blockchain Centre, Cointree and e-Pocket. @eSizeDave and @zohand gave a brief intro to Decred and its achievements to ~20 attendees and used the opportunity to engage with them more directly. ([report](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20191215-crypto-and-christmas-melbourne-australia.md))
- Dec 20 - Bitcoin Embassy Bar [First Anniversary Meetup](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1207380289107959809) - Mexico City, Mexico. (photos: [1](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1208204612215418887), [2](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1208257098565345282))

{governance, funding, chain forks, community forks, controversy}

The results of the Zcash community sentiment polling were [released](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/community-sentiment-collection-results/), reporting results from the community advisory panel, forum users, and the lack of any input from PoW miners who did not signal support for any proposals. Voters could signal support for all 13 proposals by voting Yes/No on each one.

There was very little support for proposals that did not continue to dedicate 20% of the block reward to development funding.

48 of the 62 Community Advisory Panel members responded to the poll. Options #12 (60% split between EFF/Zfnd, 40% to a major grants program with extra advisors) and #10 (The "grand compromise", similar distribution to #12) did well with close to 75% support. Option #13 ("Keep it simple", 50% split ECC/Zfnd) also got >50% approval.

77 forum users (of 104 eligible) voted on the proposals (accounts created after March 2019 were not eligible). #12 did the best among this group with 70% approval, #13 also did well with over 50% support.

1% of all the circulating ZEC [voted](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1200917828011876352?s=20) in the unofficial stake-weighted poll, the most popular options with this constituency were #10 and #8 (just 2 more years of 20% funding for ECC).

The Zcash Foundation decided to develop option #12 with some improvements, the rolled [back](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/proposed-nu4-zip/) on most of the improvements in response to pushback. The final slightly amended version of the proposal will be put to another community panel and forum user vote to confirm it.

[ZIP 1012](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zips/blob/master/zip-1012.rst), as it has become, involves extending the block reward for 4 years at 20%, with 35% going to ECC, 25% to Zfnd, and 40% for additional "Major Grants". Changes to the proposal involve making it more directly controlled by Zfnd, and removing a restriction that would have excluded ECC from receiving any funding as part of "major grants". Another change added to the proposal by Zfnd is to "Call for, and incentivize, development of decentralized voting and governance."

The Zcash Foundation also [donated](https://www.coindesk.com/zcash-foundation-funds-app-mixing-private-messaging-and-payments) $40,000 to Open Privacy for development of [Cwtch](https://openprivacy.ca/work/cwtch/), a decentralized messaging and payments platform.

IOTA got itself in a tangle and was [halted](https://cryptobriefing.com/iota-halts-15-hours-from-coordinator-bug/) for 15 hours due to a bug with the Coordinator. 

Jack Dorsey of Twitter [announced](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106) that Twitter would fund research into a decentralized version of its platform.

Algorand relay nodes voted to [accept](https://algorand.foundation/long-term-vesting-plan-vote-result) an [amendment](https://algorandfoundation.cdn.prismic.io/algorandfoundation/eb2a8c69-2262-42f8-99a4-09df485207b5_EIP-11252019AF_+Conditional+Accelerated+Vesting+Nov+30.pdf) to the vesting schedule of the tokens they received as grants from the Algorand Foundation. This amendment increases the number of Algo tokens relay nodes will receive by 25%, but extends the vesting schedule from 2 to 5 years, with a mechanism to speed it up if the Algo price rises. This concludes an [episode](https://algorand.foundation/voting-procedure-eip09092019pc) which started and was missed in Sep, with relay nodes voting to suspend their own rewards until a change to the vesting schedule could be agreed.

There are around 81 Algorand relay nodes and these proposals were approved with yes votes from around 55 nodes. The Algorand nodes have completed KYC/AML checks and entered into a legal agreement with the foundation, such that part of the voting process for these proposals involved using DocuSign to sign and return copies of the amendment to the Foundation. KYC/AML checks are also [mandatory](https://algorand.foundation/200millionalgo-staking-rewards-kyc-extended) for Algo holders who wish to participate in staking and receive rewards.

Reading finance coverage in past issues you might have wondered why everybody is not talking about financial instability? One of the reasons is _distraction_, and a data point supporting it: https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-the-average-adult-will-watch-more-than-78000-hours-of-tv/
