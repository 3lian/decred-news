Translations are challenging. In the past there was an attempt to do community translations and it had a lot of problems that led to a decision to use professional service. But that doesn't guarantee accurate translations that don't raise eyebrows of native speakers. Verifying translations to a language you don't speak is challenging. Therefore anyone is welcome to let the team know about poor quality translations.
