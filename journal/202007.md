## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ below are PRs merged between 07-01 and 07-26, update again when the month ends }

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- added more [test coverage](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2069) for the `rpcserver` package
- [exported](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2243) several `txscript` functions that are independently useful to make the Treasury PR a bit smaller
- [exported](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2240) various consensus functions and types as a step to remove all non-consensus code out of the `txscript` package
- field normalization code [hardened](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2258) against the possibility of non-constant time operations due to branch prediction (primarily based on a [pull request](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/pull/1084) to btcd from 2017). The PR demonstrates a way of detecting non-constant time behavior by looking at the assembly output.
- added handling of [`notfound`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2253) peer message (increase peer's ban score and stop requesting blocks and transactions that were not found by it) { did I read it right? }
- mining code [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1965) into `mining` package
- [`mempool`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2274), [`mining`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2275) and [`fees`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2287) converted from exported modules to internal packages to reduce the maintenance burden. This is part of the overall effort to reduce the total number of modules and eventually get to the point that it will be possible to follow semver for the root module.
- `rpcserver` code [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2288) from the main module to a standalone internal package
- `cpuminer` [refactored](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2276) into its own package to improve testability and facilitate reuse
- `cpuminer` [reworked](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2277) to use the background block template generator to simplify testing with simulation test networks

{ maybe add summary of module movements }

{ maybe add code/contributor stats }

In progress:

- devs decided to use Schnorr signatures on TSPEND transactions

    - { note that commit link may change if rebased }
  - { get as much as possible, why, how }

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- added optional [gaplimit](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1761) parameter to the `discoverusage` command
- added optional [account](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1767) parameter to the `listunspent` command
- bug fixes

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- backup and restore of the [SCB file](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2535) generated by dcrlnd (see explanation in the [docs](https://docs.decred.org/lightning-network/backups/))
- display of basic [LN info](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2575)
- added back proper [decoding](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2523) of staking transactions (needed for signing messages for the VSP)
- continued [upgrading](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pulls?q=functional+is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-07-01..2020-07-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc) the codebase to modern React using functional components and CSS modules
- initial PoC support of the new [vspd](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2516) staking process
- bug fixes

{ what is the overall status of the transition to functional components, custom hooks and CSS modules? and are any practical benefits showing up already? }

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

Multiple new [features](https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1285955294703411201) have been deployed to the [proposals.decred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/) site: RFP process, flat display of comments (helps to quickly spot new comments without hunting them down in the thread), dark mode, short proposal URLs, and a switch to block commenting once a day instead of once an hour (workaround for a limitation that will be fixed with the migration to the tlog backend).

## Network

{ hint:

- check dcrdata.org (preferred), dcrstats.com and charts.dcr.farm to get the numbers
- use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

Hashrate: [July's hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month. Pool [hashrate distribution](https://dcrstats.com/pow) as of {date} (approximate): {pool name n%, ...}.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was {n.n, try to snapshot it on 1st} DCR (+{n.n}). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=t1-t2&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, which corresponded to {n.n}-{n.n}% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.

## Markets

In July DCR was trading between USD {n.nn}-{n.nn} / BTC {}-{}. The average daily rate was ${n.nn}.

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

@PermabullNino [explored](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-mini-pub-1-relative-mvrv-ratio-ea2564ca420f) several new metrics derived from BTC and DCR realized caps that can reflect holder psychology and market over-/under-valuation.
