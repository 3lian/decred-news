## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- added more [test coverage](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2069) for the `rpcserver` package
- [exported](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2243) several `txscript` functions that are independently useful to make the Treasury PR a bit smaller
- [exported](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2240) various consensus functions and types as a step to remove all non-consensus code out of the `txscript` package
- field normalization code [hardened](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2258) against the possibility of non-constant time operations due to branch prediction (primarily based on a [pull request](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/pull/1084) to btcd from 2017). The PR demonstrates a way of detecting non-constant time behavior by _simply_ looking at the assembly output.
- added handling of [`notfound`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2253) peer message (increase peer's ban score and stop requesting blocks and transactions that were not found by it) { did I read it right? }
- mining code [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1965) into `mining` package
- [`mempool`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2274), [`mining`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2275) and [`fees`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2287) converted from exported modules to internal packages to reduce the maintenance burden. This is part of the overall effort to reduce the total number of modules and eventually get to the point that it will be possible to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the root module.
- memory usage optimizations in [stake](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2294) node pruning, txscript [stack](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2298), trace [logging](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2301), and [chain tip](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2302) tracking code
- `rpcserver` code [moved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2288) from the main module to a standalone internal package
- `cpuminer` [refactored](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2276) into its own package to improve testability and facilitate reuse
- `cpuminer` [reworked](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2277) to use the background block template generator to simplify testing with simulation test networks

Commenting on the status of optimizations:

> Flame graph for CPU usage shows pretty clearly that things are being dominated by IO now, so the biggest speedups left will definitely come from that front. ~10% GC, <1% validation, ~3.5% peer I/O, ~55% disk I/O, ~3% profiling cost, ~27% idle, and the rest in minor bits and bobs. ([@davecgh](https://matrix.to/#/!zefvTnlxYHPKvJMThI:decred.org/$U9ybkey7ppiqGR_K_BagIHwcoyNGTS-H91hEaXzghmI))

{ maybe add summary of module movements }

{ maybe add code/contributor stats }

In progress:

- decentralized Treasury [pull request](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2170) has more than 300 comments now
- devs decided to use Schnorr signatures on TSPEND transactions

{ Schnorr sounds exciting, any extra info is welcome! (why, how) }

{ any other comments on Treasury are welcome too ofc }

If you have some idle hardware, you can help by [fuzz testing](https://github.com/degeri/dcrd-continuous-fuzz) dcrd.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- added optional [gaplimit](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1761) parameter to the `discoverusage` command
- added optional [account](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1767) parameter to the `listunspent` command
- implemented [`ticketinfo`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1783) method that provides detailed status information regarding all tickets of the wallet (needed for vspd)
- added CoinJoin [params](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1780) to the `PurchaseTicketRequest` call
- implemented [`getpeerinfo`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1797) command in SPV mode
- added new command to change wallet's public [passphrase](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1510)
- bug fixes

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- backup and restore of the [SCB file](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2535) generated by dcrlnd (see explanation in the [docs](https://docs.decred.org/lightning-network/backups/))
- display of basic [LN info](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2575)
- added back proper [decoding](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2523) of staking transactions (needed for signing messages for the VSP)
- continued [upgrading](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pulls?q=functional+is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-07-01..2020-07-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc) the codebase to modern React using functional components and CSS modules
- initial PoC support of the new [vspd](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2516) staking system
- support for [short](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2602) proposal URLs
- don't require passphrase when importing [redeem](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2616) scripts
- bug fixes

{ what is the overall status of the transition to functional components, custom hooks and CSS modules? and are any practical benefits showing up already? }

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

- command-line [utility](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1240) to test the RFP process
- improved test coverage
- bug fixes

Multiple new [features](https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1285955294703411201) have been deployed to the [proposals.decred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/) site: RFP process, flat display of comments (helps to quickly spot new comments without hunting them down in the thread), dark mode, short proposal URLs, and a switch to restrict posting comments once a day instead of once an hour (workaround for a limitation that will be fixed with the migration to the tlog backend).

CMS:

- admin [searching](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2033) contractors by domain or type
- display proposal [names](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2041) instead of tokens in invoice line items
- assigning proposal [ownership](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2055) (GUI)
- admin review of proposal [spending](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2032) summary and details
- new tab for proposal [owners](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2046) to review billing details
- [highlighting](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2057) for illegal characters in invoice line items

[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd):

- voting wallet [consistency](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/86) checks (the [last](https://twitter.com/JamieHoldstock/status/1288030715486056448) major change necessary for the release)
- admin table showing the [status](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/149) of each voting wallet
- API versioning and a few bug fixes

{ anything to add? }

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

- updated to use latest [dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/90) and [dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/105)
- new [chainscan](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/83) package that uses committed filters to detect transactions relevant for the LN node more efficiently and can also operate in SPV mode
- [implementations](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/92) for chainntnfs package and a [driver](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/93) for the chainview package that use embedded and remote dcrwallet as a source of chain events. This allows to further decouple dcrlnd from an underlying dcrd, which is a requirement for having a dcrlnd instance running in SPV mode.
- [switched](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/94) the main dcrlnd package to use the new wallet-backed drivers so that chain IO operations are now fully performed by the underlying dcrwallet instance and dcrlnd no longer requires a connection to a running dcrd to perform its job
- enable and test [SPV mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/95) for remote wallets (see [March issue](202003.md#development) for more background)
- [ported](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/99) upstream lnd changes between v0.9.0-beta and 0.10.0-beta - 139 upstream PRs (plus a few non-PR'd commits) were considered for inclusion

[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex):

- { unbookHook for swapper: please translate to English or drop https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/475 }
- [smart fees](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/505): orders reserve enough for a "max fee rate" in case BTC fees are high when the order is filled, but the optimal network fee at match time is used for the swap contract transaction
- server [ban](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/469) and [unban](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/479) endpoints
- infrastructure for [upgrading](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/448) client database
- added [nomatch](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/535) notification { how does it work? notable for end users? }
- multiple bug fixes, testing improvements, and UI tweaks

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrandroid):

- updated French translation
- bug fixes
- fetching Politeia [proposals](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrlibwallet/pull/153) added to dcrlibwallet base library

@PermabullNino [explored](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-mini-pub-1-relative-mvrv-ratio-ea2564ca420f) several new metrics derived from BTC and DCR realized caps that can reflect holder psychology and market over-/under-valuation.

Binance [opened](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/i0gk1i/dcrusdt_on_binance/) a DCR/USDT market.
