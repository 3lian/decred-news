@oregonisaac {@isaac?} is [looking](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15474111512672Whvns:decred.org) for Java developers to evaluate requirements for ATM integration. Draft of the RPF document was posted and discussed here https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$154828004015153jWdiD:decred.org , there is some concensus to use 2-phase voting: first vote to see if stakeholders want ATMs at all, and second to chose a specific implementation. Another good point discussed was whether to wait for mobile apps releases before proceeding with the ATMs.

Discussions:

* attack vector: offer to airdrop some token to stakeholders in return for funding a proposal https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15468733339790vCEoH:decred.org

## Outreach

{overview of outreach/communications/marketing activity for past month and any short-term plans}

Ditto's Bi-Weekly Update https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154688457110052CiWYd:decred.org , one thing they learned that week was:

> The community welcomes and encourages questions, even if the person asking fears that their questions are "stupid." We've observed a spirit of collaboration and willingness to help that we haven't seen in other communities. It's refreshing!

Ditto has set up a system to catch every piece of media written about Decred and to address inaccuracies in real time. As a test case for that workflow one horrible article was scrutinized by the community and Ditto collected the feedback for that and future cases. Another issue discussed was integrating Ditto's workflow with voluntary submissions from the community. https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15468814029997AWtQJ:decred.org

Ditto shared a second version of the Foundational Messaging document https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154706728112462ubmNo:decred.org
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19r9SjOWin4Fb9E2_90S7mdsG0BNxRBSYzsJjSYK2Jjw/edit

Tagline for Decred was extensively discussed [in #marketing](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154711632712869dqRko:decred.org) and [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/afctai/tagline_to_capture_the_decred_project/).

On Jan 11 Ditto [reported](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$1547232200845NiZnO:decred.org) about the Forbes article and advised individuals to share it because amplification is just as important as the media placement itself.

Example of "thought leadership" placement can be seen the [comment here](https://cryptobriefing.com/scaling-delay-ethereum-constantinople/) by @richardred. {keep? reword?} In the following [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15476630757260cGbJc:decred.org) of it an issue was raised that Decred and Ethereum have very different backgrounds and this must be taken into account.

## Media

[blog.dcrclub.org](https://blog.dcrclub.org/) is a new website in Chinese that collects various articles and translations in one place. The source hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/0x5826/blog.dcrclub.org) makes it easy to contribute or mirror the website on other domain for more resiliency. Credits to @TogT4V (Telegram) for starting the site.

[Decred page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decred) on Wikipedia is under attack again. On Jan 8 user R2d232h2 [removed](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Decred&diff=prev&oldid=877407037) a bunch of "bad sources". On Jan 10 the same user [vandalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Decred&diff=next&oldid=877407037) the page by removing a large and important part of content. Just 4 hours later another user nominated Decred page for deletion - the [3rd attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%283rd_nomination%29) to take it down. On Jan 11 the second purge was reverted and R2d232h2 was banned as sockpuppet, but next day the removal was applied again. As it stands after the cutting, the page is very small and has all [votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%283rd_nomination%29) to delete it. All suggested recent articles in major crypto media are [not good enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Decred#Request_edit_on_12_January_2019) references. For background, the author of [2nd nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%282nd_nomination%29) for deletion had interesting [views](https://archive.today/QAlRp) on notability of articles and was [banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Prince_of_Thieves) as a sockpuppet. Extensively discussed [in #marketing](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$1547202592212vKSyw:decred.org) ([continued](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15472392171087ucpIb:decred.org)), including possilble solutions. The page was deleted on Jan 18. More details are captured in [this issue](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/79).

The good news, is it [can mean](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15474897963391hhDDU:decred.org) Decred is moving in the right direction.

More [criticism](https://twitter.com/tonevays/status/1086702239853379584) from Bitcoin maximalists triggered a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ahuawl/decred_launch_security_laws/) on how Decred looks in context of securities laws. One vector critics use is that Decred's premine and airdrop was not fair and "hand selected". This is a misrepresentation of the (huge) manual effort to filter out airdrop cheaters, per [this discussion]( https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154810656412322VrQLg:decred.org) that also has many useful links describing Decred's launch. One interesting insight shared there is that ~300k (35%) airdropped coins never moved. Another related [chat](https://matrix.to/#/!kdpEDksmOMNrlMqffD:decred.org/$15467943549316LjeYZ:decred.org) was about Twitter attacks claiming how Decred's initial distribution was not transparent or fair, while avoiding inconvenient facts about Bitcoin's early mining. Finally, this [history lesson](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15467944729319gvTvt:decred.org) explained early days of staking and made a point that original devs had no unilateral control of consensus rules from day 1.

{ETH ProgPoW and governance news -- worthy?}

Fundamentals of Proof of Work [article](https://blog.sia.tech/fundamentals-of-proof-of-work-beaa68093d2b) by David Vorick makes the case for exclusive hardware cryptocurrencies and contrasts them with shared hardware cryptocurrencies that suffer from multiple issues, especially ASIC-resistant ones. One of the issues with non specialized hardware is hashrate marketplaces. They allow hardware owners to better profit from their hardware by not caring about which coin they mine, even if the hashrate is rented to attackers. Decred benefits from specialized hardware but is not "exclusive" to it, other coins exist or may appear in future that use the same mining algorithm. What protects Decred is the (current) hashrate dominance for its algorithm and the ability to strip mining rewards from the blocks.

{governance, forks, chain splits, controversy}

Updated version of the "forkonomy" research by Wassim Alsindi (@parallelind) was [published](https://hackernoon.com/towards-an-analytical-discipline-of-forkonomy-summer-2018-e6da993ee3f9) along with an up-to-date [follow-up](https://medium.com/@parallelind/forkonomy-revisited-where-are-they-now-73fbfbec6b4d).

Hcash forked a few [more](https://archive.today/rEhWX) Decred projects: [Autonomy](https://archive.today/KTCdX) (Politeia), [hcexplorer](https://archive.today/2KTtW) and [hctime](https://archive.today/K151A). In Politeia, they accidently [removed](https://archive.today/ECplt) copyright of Decred developers and forgot to rename the project. After being notified they quickly reacted by removing multiple repositories from TKFORKED account,  [reinstating](https://github.com/TKFORKED/autonomy/commit/4b05c2c31829df64be69e546d939a563247e1927) the license and [renaming](https://github.com/TKFORKED/autonomy/commit/98d5f63f676e45e6a91eba99da3db985effdb1f2) the Politeia fork to Autonomy. A few [missed](https://twitter.com/michae2xl/status/1084270468234915840) subtle Decred icons were fixed. Some [projects](https://archive.today/https://github.com/HcashOrg/hc*) were forked with their commit history erased and without marking them as forks on GitHub. Complaints on their subreddit were silently censored without reply ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/hcash/comments/adwmx2/hcash_being_shady_again/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/hcash/comments/afepsc/hcash_cant_be_bothered_to_change_the_decred_logo/).
