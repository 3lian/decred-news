# {DRAFT} Decred Journal â€“ January 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

{introduction, major news of the month}

{Android release, end of Jan or early Feb? include?}

Node and wallet software v1.4.0 was released on Feb 6 after extensive testing. Full release notes and downloads are [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0). As always, make sure to [verify the downloads](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries/). More coverage in Feb issue of Decred Journal.

New consensus vote agenda added in v1.4.0 is critical for Lightning Network, upgrade is highly recommended.

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): An [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1568) was discovered in v1.4.0 RC1. The large change to UTXO set semantics accidentally fixed a bug in consensus rules. Old incorrect behavior was [preserved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1570) until a consensus vote can take place to correct it. Thanks to everybody who helped to discover and fix the bug.

The code for the consensus vote is [completed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1579) and included in the final [v1.4.0 release](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0). The fix and vote was prioritized because it is required for Lightning Network. [DCP004](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0004/dcp-0004.mediawiki) (Decred Change Proposal) explains the change in detail and reminds of useful applications of relative locks beyond LN. Side effect of this work was [refactoring](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1583) and reinforcement of tests in that area.

Discussion [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1593) how to further improve stake difficulty algorithm by removing oscillations - this could make ticket price even more smooth.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): {remove this if nothing significant}

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): bug fixes and preparation for v1.4.0 release.

A feature to specify config options as command line arguments [merged](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1975) to master.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): [Cache layer](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/660) entered review phase. Onboarding popup was [replaced](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/986) with relevant links to docs. Thanks to lemonkabir for discovering a couple of [security](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/647) [issues](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/650).

Discussions:

* Missing admin [feature](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/662) to censor public proposal was identified and discussed: there must be a way to remove a public proposal that was edited to include abusive content, implementation [started](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/991).
* Developers are discussing [automated end-to-end testing](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/976) and [QA checklist](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/977) for major changes.
* Large frontend code refactoring discussion [started](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/990) to address complexity, performance and dev productivity issues. First proposed [solution](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/990#issuecomment-454535696) is to use GraphQL.

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): Final version 1.0 was released! Get it on Google Play Store for [mainnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet) or [testnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.testnet) wallets. Test coins can be requested via the [faucet](http://faucet.decred.org/). Feedback is welcome [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/am7j40/decred_wallet_for_android_v10_released/) and bug reports [on GitHub](http://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues).

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): preview is [available](https://testflight.apple.com/join/dvq51tCh) on Apple TestFlight.

Trezor: {any news?}

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): New home page design is [advancing](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/921). Values on the home page now [update automatically](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/961) when new block is found. Exchange rate monitoring was [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/951) to the backend that enables showing USD values on the UI. HTTPS is now enforced on `explorer` and `mainnet` subdomains ([discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$154818146313660CWvZy:decred.org)).

New home page design that includes exchange rate, new address table views, improved charts and speed optimizations are [available](https://twitter.com/decredexplorer/status/1093182831487053825) in v4 beta at [beta.dcrdata.org](https://beta.dcrdata.org/). Detailed release notes will be compiled with the release candidate.

Dev side: @buck54321 is [destroying](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/915) imperative jQuery code. Team is preparing stress testing of Insight API _(they call it torture testing, ouch)_.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): Internal code improvements, preliminary work for Decrediton integration. A [monitoring page](https://mainnet-split-tickets.matheusd.com/) was set up that shows active splitting sessions from both VSPs that support it.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): New pages: [Operating a VSP](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/operating-a-vsp/) outlines configuration requirements and desired skillset of VSP operators, [Solo PoS Voting](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/solo-proof-of-stake-voting/) is based on the guide by @jz, [Address Details](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/address-details/) page explains address format an lists all possible kinds of addresses, [Contributing to Decred](https://docs.decred.org/contributing/contributing-to-decred/) explains how to become a paid Decred contractor.

Deep dive security discussion in #documentation concluded that it is possible to assemble general [computer security guidelines](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/101) that will be beneficial for the whole space.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): Huge effort to migrate the site to Hugo was [completed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/491) by @peter\_zen. Hugo is a static site generator written in Go that makes updating site content much easier. Several site speed [optimizations](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/513) were enabled. [voting.decred.org](https://voting.decred.org/) dashboard is being [updated](https://github.com/decred/hardforkdemo/commits/master) in preparation for the upcoming consensus vote - congrats @jholdstock with diving into Go!

Other:

* New [Bug Bounty](https://bounty.decred.org/) website is built with Hugo, source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/dcrbounty) is open for bug reports and contributions.
* {comment on contractor-mgmt sndurkin or ay-p? is it worth mentioning it yet?}
* More terminology changes in dcrwallet, dcrdocs and dcrweb.
* Projects are gradually switching to a faster golangci-lint linter.
* More security headers [enabled](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/537) on decred.org.
* [SQL interface](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/agpkjv/sql_interface_to_live_onchain_decred_data/) to Decred on-chain data might be interesting to researchers.
* GitHub now [allows](https://github.blog/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/) private repositories with up to 3 collaborators for free accounts.

Dev activity stats for January: {} active PRs, {} master commits, {} added and {} deleted lines spread across {} repositories. Contributions came from {}-{} developers per repository. ([chart]({}))

## People

Welcome to new first time contributors with code merged on GitHub: Sarlor ([dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/commits?author=Sarlor)), laszlolm ([decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits?author=laszlolm)), dezryth ([dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/commits?author=dezryth)).

Congratulations to 6 new contributors [listed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/486) on decred.org:

* David Habibi (@eSizeDave, community manager - Australia)
* Elian Huesca (@elian, community manager - Mexico)
* Marcelo Martins (@mm, Community Manager - Portugal)
* Mariusz Szyma (@mario, community manager - Poland)
* Morphy Tsai (@morphymore, community manager - Taiwan)
* Tomasz Porwit (@kozel, education and outreach)

4 inactive developers [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/528) from decred.org: Cruz Molina (@freethinkingaway, dcrdata), Huy Nguyen Tuan (@huyntsgs, dcrwallet), Macaulay Davies (@mcedward), Rohit Nagori.

Independent Decred contractors [published](https://medium.com/decred/decred-independent-contractor-roadmap-884faba3db39) their plans for 2019, thanks to ~15 people who contributed. The post triggered a [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15476119656176jVTYW:decred.org) about roadmaps, central planning and contractor autonomy, as well as commentary from Ditto.

## Governance

In January the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 16,776 DCR and spent 9,991 DCR. Using January's daily average DCR/USD rate of $17.1, this is $286K received and $170K spent. As these payments were for work completed in December, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the December average daily rate of $17.5 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $294K/$175K.

Contractors are now [getting paid](https://docs.decred.org/contributing/contributor-compensation/) on ~15th of each month for the prior month's work. The delay between invoicing and getting paid was cut in half from ~30th day. Work is ongoing to further lower this delay.

Decred Bug Bounty program [launched](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1087486930093264897). Check the rules on the new website [bounty.decred.org](https://bounty.decred.org/) and the intro blog post on [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/decred-launches-debug-decred-bug-bounty-program-7e4d2af27ec9). Credits to @fernandoabolafio and @jholdstock for majority of the site work. Bounty team who decides on validity of submissions and payouts includes @degeri, @dnldd, @fernandoabolafio, @jholdstock and @matheusd. Congrats team with the launch!

@Dustorf is preparing proposals to improve transparency and increase stakeholder's control of the allocation of funds for the marketing activities. Events spending [pre-proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/anhh8n/proposal_to_get_events_spending_approved_via/) by was published for feedback on Reddit after first iteration [in chat](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154896889724431Mxlvj:decred.org). Marketing budget pre-proposal also started [in chat](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154897255124536mFHoo:decred.org) and landed [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/aolr79/politeia_proposal_to_fund_marketing_ops_for_2019/) after a first round of feedback.

@oregonisaac is [looking](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15474111512672Whvns:decred.org) for Java developers to evaluate requirements for ATM integration. Draft of the proposal was posted and discussed [in chat](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$154828004015153jWdiD:decred.org). There was some concensus to use 2-phase voting where first vote determines if stakeholders want ATMs at all, and second to choose a specific implementation. This process is similar to RFP ([request for proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal)). Another good point discussed was whether to wait for mobile apps releases before proceeding with the ATMs.

Discussions:

* Baeond proposal spurred a [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15468733339790vCEoH:decred.org) of an attack vector where stakeholders are offered an airdrop of some token in return for them approving a proposal.
* [Engagement](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15481365491827928DiBLm:matrix.org) and satisfaction with Politeia so far.
* How [UX enhancements](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/678) can help voters to pre-emptively address bad proposals and stay vigilant.

## Network

Hashrate: January's hashrate opened at ~187 Ph/s and closed ~225 Ph/s, bottoming at 144 Ph/s and peaking at 312 Ph/s throughout the month. As of Feb 8, pool hashrate distribution: Poolin 29%, F2pool 26%, BTC.com 19%, UUPool 8%, Luxor 4%, CoinMine 1% and others are 13% per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 109.4 DCR (+6.4) on Feb 4 per dcrstats.com. The price varied between 101.5-111.6 DCR. Locked amount was 4.20-4.38 million DCR, which corresponded to 46.3-47.5% of the available supply.

There were 90 total split tickets in January. [Data](https://gist.github.com/oregonisaac/8eb4d50af9fa888c920666fb73ba44b2) since May 2018 shows a steady growth.

## Outreach

Marketing team is [planning](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15468814029997AWtQJ:decred.org) to approach reporters publishing inaccuracies about Decred. As a test case for that workflow one horrible article was scrutinized by the community and Ditto collected the feedback for that and future cases. Ditto has [systems](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154690407510431bVTJQ:decred.org) to catch every piece of media written about Decred. As they get to know the community better, it will be possible to address inaccuracies in real time. Another issue discussed was integrating Ditto's [corrections workflow](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/71) with voluntary submissions from the community.

Tagline for Decred was extensively discussed [in #marketing](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154711632712869dqRko:decred.org) and [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/afctai/tagline_to_capture_the_decred_project/). Final version of messaging settled it on "Decred: Secure. Adaptable. Self-Funding." which gathered most support. As time goes this will be revised to adapt to the ever changing space.

January update from Ditto:

* Went through several iterations of the foundational messaging document with significant community input and received positive feedback on the [final version](https://pastebin.com/E5L6u2RV). (discussions: [second](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154706728112462ubmNo:decred.org) version, [final](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154880432321730DYSYl:decred.org) version)
* Worked with the community to source commentary on 51% attacks for future use with reporters when another attack inevitably happens - the goal being to get Decred's message in front of journalists even when it doesn't have any hard news to share.
* Media trained three Decred members.
* Secured media coverage: [feature article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leslieankney/2019/01/11/who-should-hold-power-decred-governance-and-what-it-means-for-investors/) in Forbes ([report](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$1547232200845NiZnO:decred.org)), [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUxDxJ4YAUA) with Joshua for Bitsonline, commentary by @richardred on the delay in Ethereum's hard fork in [Breaker Mag](https://breakermag.com/what-we-know-about-the-vulnerability-behind-ethereums-rollback-of-constantinople/) and [Crypto Briefing](https://cryptobriefing.com/scaling-delay-ethereum-constantinople/).
* Drafted an announcement of the bug bounty program and [placed](https://hackernoon.com/decred-launches-debug-decred-bug-bounty-program-7e4d2af27ec9) it in Hacker Noon - thereby reaching a much broader pool of developers, compared to Decred's own channels.
* Facilitated two interviews that are pending media coverage.
* Flew down to the North American Bitcoin Conference, where Ditto facilitated interviews between Decred and reporters (Cheddar TV, Altcoin Buzz, etc.) and spent quality time with the team.
* Worked closely with Dustin on an events plan that encompasses both events Decred wants to speak at and events it wants to have a booth at.
* Submitted an application for Jake to speak at Consensus 2019.
* Worked closely with Dustin on a marketing and communications plan for the first half of 2019, spanning messaging, media training, media relations, events and speaking, and strategy. This plan is still pending.

Individuals are advised to share media coverage because amplification is just as important as the media placement itself.

For even more detail see the biweekly updates on [Jan 7](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154688457110052CiWYd:decred.org) and [Jan 18](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15478384869864RTCsv:decred.org). Nice discovery in one of them:

> The community welcomes and encourages questions, even if the person asking fears that their questions are "stupid." We've observed a spirit of collaboration and willingness to help that we haven't seen in other communities. It's refreshing!

Other:

* It is [rumored](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$15478503329998HCAzR:decred.org) that Ditto can arrange a mad beard that entitles one to wear Silver Decred Jacket.
* @anshawblack [dropped](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154792069410439nSRtR:decred.org) Decred merch in all record stores of Miami.
* Decredible shop was [renewed](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ae07as/custom_decred_merch_with_19_discount_in_the/) with extra items and new Decred logos. All products can be personalized and tweaked.

Urgent Notice: new batch of Stakey plushies is [available](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ahalex/new_batch_of_stakey_plushies_available/)!

## Events

Attended:

* [The North American Bitcoin Conference](https://btcmiami.com/) in Miami, USA. Attendance was surprisingly low: 1.8K people claimed after the event vs expected 6K. @jy-p's presentation [Applications of Blockchain Time-Stamping](https://btcmiami.com/session/applications-of-blockchain-time-stamping/) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RRTidXh_Lw)) was well done and well attended given the overall numbers. 3 members went through media training and found it useful, 7 more are scheduled. SoV, "Secure. Adaptable. Self-Funding," and the accompanying messaging was found to be a very effective way of talking about Decred. It was found to be most clear and impactful. Full report with links to photos and videos [here](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/blob/master/reports/20190116-tnabc-miami.md).
* [OKEx Global Meetup Tour](https://www.eventbrite.hk/e/okex-global-meetup-tour-2019-taiwan-tickets-54689867867) in Taipei, Taiwan. @morphymore told the story of Decred and how it works. "Compared to 2018, people are starting to recognize Decred better. A few people told me that they know about Decred from the Chinese translation I did last year of the Placeholder's Investment Thesis. It was very encouraging and shows that the Decred awareness in Taiwan is indeed growing." ([report](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$15478245399446fDEQa:decred.org), [photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/rXd9PeYmyAGrVTQN7))
* [10 lat Bitcoina](https://10latbitcoina.com.pl/) in Warsaw, Poland. @karamble talked about longevity in cryptocurrencies on the basis of Decred. The team of 4 people established relations with several crypto outlets and engaged with a few businesses. BitHub.pl noted: "The Decred boys were intensely engaged in answering questions of those interested displaying tons of patience at that, since the questions poured in basically all the time!". ([report](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/blob/master/reports/20190126-10LatBitcoina-Warsaw.md))

## Media

[blog.dcrclub.org](https://blog.dcrclub.org/) is a new website in Chinese that collects various articles and translations in one place. The source hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/0x5826/blog.dcrclub.org) makes it easy to contribute or mirror the website on other domain for more resiliency. Credits to @TogT4V (Telegram) for starting the site.

New [Arabic blog](https://decred-arabia.blogspot.com/2019/01/blog-post.html) about Decred started by @butterfly (@arij on Matrix). There are some challenges with publishing arabic text on the web, advice is welcome in #writers_room.

Portuguese podcasts [started](https://matrix.to/#/!kdpEDksmOMNrlMqffD:decred.org/$1548814257223928fVjiP:matrix.org) by @michae2xl, available on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-770106247/), Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Google Podcasts - search for "Decred Brasil".

[@decredexplorer](https://twitter.com/decredexplorer) is a new Twitter account focused on dcrdata, thanks to @michae2xl for organizing.

@Matt D [introduced](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154825336714293nfWdU:decred.org) [Decred Aggregator](https://t.me/DecredAgg) in Telegram that aims to collect news, press, videos, podcasts, Decred announcements, trending tweets and Reddit posts, as well as market stats.

@anshawblack is planning a podcast.

[Decred page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decred) on Wikipedia was deleted. On Jan 8 a user [removed](https://archive.today/ApV3P) a bunch of "bad sources". On Jan 10 the same user vandalized the page by removing a large and important part of content. Just 4 hours later another user nominated Decred page for deletion - the [3rd attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%283rd_nomination%29) to take it down. On Jan 11 content removal was reverted and its author was banned as sockpuppet, but next day the removal was [applied again](https://archive.today/fZUHW) by another user without much commentary. After the cutting the page became very small and all reviewers [voted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decred_%283rd_nomination%29) to delete it. All suggested recent articles in major crypto media were deemed [not good enough](https://archive.today/4xwaN) references.

* Drop in Telegram user count is likely due to a bot purge.
* @sambiohazard wrote a thorough [plan](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/16) to address Discord spam, implemented it, and reported no spam after first few weeks. Several important channels were bridged with Discord. With this in place we can finally appreciate Discord as an opportunity to onboard more people. Thank you!

[Criticism](https://twitter.com/tonevays/status/1086702239853379584) from Bitcoin maximalists triggered a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ahuawl/decred_launch_security_laws/) on how Decred looks in context of securities laws. One vector critics use is that Decred's premine and airdrop was not fair and "hand selected". This is a misrepresentation of the (huge) manual effort to filter out airdrop cheaters, per [this discussion]( https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154810656412322VrQLg:decred.org) that also has many useful links describing Decred's launch. One interesting insight shared there is that ~300k (35%) airdropped coins never moved. Another related [chat](https://matrix.to/#/!kdpEDksmOMNrlMqffD:decred.org/$15467943549316LjeYZ:decred.org) was about Twitter attacks claiming how Decred's initial distribution was not transparent or fair, while avoiding inconvenient facts about Bitcoin's early mining and Satoshi's million BTC. Finally, this [history lesson](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15467944729319gvTvt:decred.org) explained early days of staking and made a point that original devs had no unilateral control of consensus rules from day 1.

{PoW, ASIC resistance, tech}

Ethereum Classic (ETC) was subject to a 51% attack, with the alert being raised by [CoinNess](https://www.coinness.com/news/198264) on Jan 7.  Coinbase then [announced](https://blog.coinbase.com/ethereum-classic-etc-is-currently-being-51-attacked-33be13ce32de) that it had detected a deep reorganization of the ETC chain and had halted ETC transactions. The article lists a number of reorgs that involved double spends, putting the total amount involved at $1.1 million, across 15 distinct reorg events. Coinbase was not itself a target for these attacks. The Gate.io exchange subsequently [announced](https://www.gate.io/article/16735) that it had been targeted and had lost around $200k, and that it would absorb the loss. Gate.io also significantly increased the number of confirmations required for ETC deposits. In an unusual development, the attacker then [returned](https://www.gate.io/article/16740) $100k of the ETC to gate.io, they have tried but failed to make contact with the attacker and do not know the reason for the return of funds. Other victims of the ETC double spends have not come forward. 

Ethereum's developers [decided](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-developers-give-tentative-greenlight-to-asic-blocking-code) (tentatively)  on Jan 4 to go ahead with a change of mining algorithm from Ethash to ProgPoW. This move is intended to stop ASICs from mining Ethereum.

Ethereum developers also [delayed](https://breakermag.com/what-we-know-about-the-vulnerability-behind-ethereums-rollback-of-constantinople/) the Constantinople hard fork on Jan 15 after a security vulnerability which would have enabled a "reentrancy attack" was [detected](https://medium.com/chainsecurity/constantinople-enables-new-reentrancy-attack-ace4088297d9). 

Fundamentals of Proof of Work [article](https://blog.sia.tech/fundamentals-of-proof-of-work-beaa68093d2b) by David Vorick makes the case for exclusive hardware cryptocurrencies and contrasts them with shared hardware cryptocurrencies that suffer from multiple issues, especially ASIC-resistant ones. One of the issues with non specialized hardware is hashrate marketplaces. They allow hardware owners to better profit from their hardware by not caring about which coin they mine, even if the hashrate is rented to attackers. Decred benefits from specialized hardware but is not "exclusive" to it, other coins exist or may appear in future that use the same mining algorithm. What protects Decred is the (current) hashrate dominance for its algorithm and the ability to strip mining rewards from the blocks.

The first round of Aragon proposal voting [concluded](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-1/) on Jan 26. Of the 12 submitted proposals, 3 were excluded from the vote by the Aragon Foundation (1 because of lack of full time leadership and engineering talent, 2 were excluded to reduce cognitive load on voters). 8 of the 9 proposals voted on were [approved](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0x277bfcf7c2e162cb1ac3e9ae228a3132a75f83d4) by ANT holders, with one proposal (to change the voting period duration from 48 hours to 1 week) rejected. ANT participation rates [ranged](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0x277bfcf7c2e162cb1ac3e9ae228a3132a75f83d4) from 2.3 to 7.8%. The most expensive [proposal](https://github.com/aragon/flock/blob/master/teams/Aragon%20One/2019.md) to be approved will pay Aragon One $4 million for 2019 operating costs plus an incentive package consisting of 1.675 million ANT on a 5 year vesting schedule. An incentive in ANT with a vesting schedule was included as part of most proposals, in addition to the main cost to be paid in DAI. In total this round of approved proposals will cost around $5.94 million + 2.52 million ANT (~$880k).

The EOS referendum system for constitutional amendments went [live](https://medium.com/@eosnationbp/the-fate-of-eos-is-in-the-hands-of-token-holders-3d345147ef6) on Jan 11. So far 77 proposals have been [submitted](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums). The voting period for these proposals is flexible and specified by the submitter, some last as long as four months. The proposals with the most votes (as of Jan 31) have votes from around 2% of circulating EOS, but most proposals have very low participation (only 10 have greater than 0.5% participation). So far the most popular proposals are to [change](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/rex4all) where the fees for short names and RAM purchases go, [delete](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/decaf) the EOS Core Arbitration Forum, and [burn](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/burnsaving) the inflation funds in eosio.saving (to be used for funding the worker proposal system).

The NEM Foundation [announced](https://forum.nem.io/t/nem-foundation-message-to-the-community/21753) that it is in financial difficulty and needs to downsize its workforce. A new council took over the foundation on January 1 and when they opened the books they saw a problem. The previous council had a burn rate of 9 million XEM per month ($360k now, considerably more at the time) which was spent by independent regional entities on promotional activities with little accountability. This was deemed not sustainable, and the new council has restructured the foundation and is presently seeking additional funds.

Hcash forked a few [more](https://archive.today/rEhWX) Decred projects: [Autonomy](https://archive.today/KTCdX) (Politeia), [hcexplorer](https://archive.today/2KTtW) and [hctime](https://archive.today/K151A). In Politeia, they accidentally [removed](https://archive.today/ECplt) copyright of Decred developers and forgot to rename the project. After being notified they quickly reacted by removing multiple repositories from TKFORKED account,  [reinstating](https://github.com/TKFORKED/autonomy/commit/4b05c2c31829df64be69e546d939a563247e1927) the license and [renaming](https://github.com/TKFORKED/autonomy/commit/98d5f63f676e45e6a91eba99da3db985effdb1f2) the Politeia fork to Autonomy. A few [missed](https://twitter.com/michae2xl/status/1084270468234915840) subtle Decred icons were fixed. Some [projects](https://archive.today/https://github.com/HcashOrg/hc*) were forked with their commit history erased and without marking them as forks on GitHub. Complaints on their subreddit were silently censored without reply ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/hcash/comments/adwmx2/hcash_being_shady_again/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/hcash/comments/afepsc/hcash_cant_be_bothered_to_change_the_decred_logo/).
