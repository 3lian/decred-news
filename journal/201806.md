# Decred Journal — June 2018 DRAFT

## Development

The biggest announcement of the month was the new kind of decentralized exchange [proposed](https://blog.decred.org/2018/06/05/A-New-Kind-of-DEX/) by Company 0. Check Community Discussions section for more on this.

dcrd: Peer management and connectivity improvements. Some work for [improved sighash algo](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/950). A new [optimization](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1273) that gives 3-4x faster serving of headers, which is great for SPV. This was another step towards multipeer parallel downloads — check [this issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145) for a clear overview of progress and planned work for next months. As usual, codebase cleanup, improvements to error handling, test infrastructure and test coverage.

Decrediton: work towards watching only wallets, lots of bugfixes and visual design improvements.

Trezor: Decred appeared in [firmware update](https://blog.trezor.io/june-updates-trezor-one-firmware-wallet-zcash-cashaddr-doge-e21cbdf9807d) and on [trezor website](https://trezor.io/coins/#DCR). Next step is integration in wallets. For Decrediton support you can track [this meta issue](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1491).

Politeia is live on testnet! Useful links: [announcement](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1009552512968482818), CLI session [example](https://gist.github.com/marcopeereboom/ee494a6864086e0b5a4ac8886a9c0397), [example proposal](https://test-proposals.decred.org/proposals/c5241806166d89286be56cd2605e7d76537eb32a40a8f8d8bde3bff4c2fc6585/) with some votes, [mini-guide](https://github.com/decred/politeia/blob/master/politeia.md) how to compose a proposal.

dcrdata: Continued work on Insight API support, see this [master issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/400) for progress overview. It is important for integrations since Insight API is very popular. Ongoing work to add charts. A big database change to improve sorting on the Address page was [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/commit/006685be846ac9cfe7b9b76eebabdb7bffdaad18) and bumped version to 3.0. Work to visualize agenda voting [continues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/523).

Ticket splitting: 11-way ticket split from last month [has voted](https://twitter.com/matheusd_tech/status/1007610236868399104) ([transaction](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/957728a7b3b9ea02338552470535ca67a6bc4379b169959589b8a69060e764a8)).

Ethereum support in atomicswap is [progressing](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/issues/74) and welcomes more eyeballs.

decred.org: revamped [Press page](https://decred.org/press/) with dozens of added articles, and a shiny new [Roadmap page](https://decred.org/roadmap/).

[decredinfo.com](https://decredinfo.com/): a new Decred dashboard by lte13. Reddit announcement [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8tcs49/decredinfo_block_explorer_and_statistics_for/).

## Network

Hashrate: growth continues, starting the month at 15 and ending at 44 PH/s with some wild 30% hashrate swings in the process. The peak was 53.9 PH/s.

F2Pool was the leader varying between 36% and 59% hashrate, followed by coinmine.pl holding between 18% and 29%.

F2Pool made a [statement](https://www.f2pool.com/help/profits/annoce) in response to concerns about its hashrate share:

> For the stable development of community, F2Pool has already ceased the promotion of DCR pool, and considers to take measure like raising up the mining fee to reduce the pool hashrate if it is necessary, to prevent the capability of 51% attack. Meanwhile, with responsibility and sense of justice, F2Pool reminds "NO evil" as the principle. Thus, we do not, and will never destroy the stability of community and seek improper profits through 51% attack.  
> Together with the community, we do sincerely hope to contribute to protect the healthy trend of Decred. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3P6R055Z/p1529402169000047))

Staking: 30-day average ticket price is 94.7 DCR (+3.4). The price was steadily rising from 90.7 to 95.8 peaking at 98.1. Locked DCR grew from 3.68 to 3.81 million DCR, the highest value was 3.83 million corresponding to 47.87% supply (+0.7% from previous peak).

Nodes: there are 240 public listening and 115 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 57% on v1.2.0 (+12%), 25% on v1.1.2 (-13%), 14% on v1.1.0 (-1%). Note: the reported count of non-listening nodes has dropped significantly due to data reset at decred.eu. It will take some time before the crawler collects more or less complete data. On top of that, there is no way to exactly count non-listening nodes. To illustrate, an alternative data source, charts.dcr.farm [showed](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000015/nodes-map) 690 nodes reachable nodes during 24 hours on Jul 1.

Extraordinary event: [247361](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/247361) and [247362](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/247362) were two nearly full blocks. Normally blocks are 10-20 KiB, but these blocks were 374 KiB (max is 384 KiB).

## ASICs

[Update](https://medium.com/obelisk-blog/obelisk-update-may-june-2018-260fce12a825) from Obelisk: shipping is expected in first half of July and there is non-zero chance to meet hashrate target.

Security notice was posted on #pow-mining:

> jz: There has been a report that some D9 miners (not necessarily acquired directly from the manufacturer) may be running a rogue firmware that mines to a pool other than the one that the user has configured. Users should make sure they are running the latest firmware, acquired directly from the manufacturer, and double check all their settings. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3P6R055Z/p1528500842000018))

Another Chinese ASIC [spotted](https://www.dcrbi.com/) on the web: Flying Fish D18 with 340 GH/s at 180 W costing 2,200 CNY (~340 USD). ([asicok.com](https://asicok.com/d18.html) – [translated](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&hl=en&u=https://asicok.com/d18.html), also on [asicminervalue](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/ffminer/decred-d18))

dcrASIC team [posted](https://medium.com/@dcrasic/farewell-from-dcrasic-5327953088b0) a farewell letter. Despite having an awesome 16 nm chip design, they decided to stop the project citing the saturated mining ecosystem and low profitability for their potential customers.

## Integrations

[bepool.org](http://beepool.org/) is a new mining pool [spotted](https://dcred.eu/powStats) on dcred.eu.

Exchange integrations:

* Huobi Pro [added](https://www.huobipro.com/notice_detail/?id=1855) DCR/BTC and DCR/ETH pairs.
* OKEx gradually [rolled out](https://support.okex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004847791-Decred-DCR-Now-Available) trading DCR to BTC, ETH, USDT and OKB and added [a page](https://support.okex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004847771-Decred-DCR-) for Decred (note a bunch of N/As near ICO-related stats).
* Singapore-based DragonEx [announced](https://twitter.com/Dragonex_io/status/1007229686328356864) a DCR/ETH pair.
* Netherlands-based Bitvavo recently added [EUR to DCR](https://bitvavo.com/decred) conversion
* OOOBTC [announced](https://twitter.com/ooobtcExchange/status/1009076226655338497) DCR/USDT pair.
* Changenow [announced](https://twitter.com/ChangeNOW_io/status/1011242774585278464) the option to buy DCR with fiat.

Two OTC trading desks are now shown on decred.org [exchanges](https://decred.org/exchanges/) page.

[BitPro](https://bitpro.cc/) payment gateway added Decred and [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8og4he/bitpro_payment_gateway_adds_decred/) on our sub. Notably, it is fully functional for users without javascript, among other [features](https://bitpro.cc/start).

Guarda Wallet integrated Decred. Currently only in their web wallet, but more may come in future. Notable feature is "DCR purchase with a bank card". See more details in their [post](https://medium.com/guarda/guarda-adds-decred-support-to-the-multi-currency-web-wallet-7ec9b88a7738) or ask their representative on our [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8pa74w/guarda_announces_decred_is_now_on_our/). Important to note: do your best to understand the security model before using any wallet software.

## Adoption

[NeverFiat](https://www.neverfiat.com/) marketplace now [accepts](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8v0ii9/we_are_building_tomorrows_crypto_marketplace/) Decred. Notably it utilizes [GloBee](https://globee.com/) and recently announcent [Lightning support](https://neverfiat.com/blogs/blog/neverfiat-accepts-lightning-network-payments) for Bitcoin.

BlueYard Capital [announced](https://twitter.com/blueyard/status/1007287271643598849) investment in Decred and the intent to be long term [supporters](https://twitter.com/ciaranoleary/status/1007288469952126977) and to actively participate in the network's governance. In an [overview post](https://medium.com/@BlueYard/decred-82b284b4a795) they stressed core values of the project:

> There are a few other remarkable characteristics that are a testament to the DNA of the team behind Decred: there was no sale of DCR to investors, no venture funding, and no payment to exchanges to be listed — underscoring that the Decred team and contributors are all about doing the right thing for long term (as manifested in their [constitution](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/constitution/) for the project).

> The most encouraging thing we can see is both the quality and quantity of high calibre developers flocking to the project, in addition to a vibrant community attaching their identity to the project.

The company will be hosting an event in Berlin, see Events below.

Second issue of Chinese ratings [released](http://special.ccidnet.com/pub-bc-eval/). Compared to [first issue](https://archive.today/4Xhz6), Decred dropped from 26 to 29 while Bitcoin fell from 13 to 17. We (authors) try hard to refrain from commenting this one.

Slack

New channel [#thedex](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CB1BDE40Z/) was created to discuss the DEX proposal after hot discussions on [#general](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1528209752000802), [#random](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PAYQJTW/p1528210469000917) and [#trading](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1528209357000114). It has more than 100 people now and already attracted some developers.

A frequent and reasonable question is how the DEX would benefit Decred. @lukebp has put it well:

> Projects like these help Decred attract talent. Typically, the people that are the best at what they do aren’t driven solely by money.  They want to work on interesting projects that they believe in with other talented individuals.  
> Launching a DEX that has no trading fees, no requirement to buy a 3rd party token (including Decred), and that cuts out all middlemen is a clear demonstration of the ethos that Decred was founded on.  It helps us get our name out there and attract the type of people that believe in the same mission that we do. ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PAYQJTW/p1528212405000365))

Another concern that it will slow down other projects was addressed by @davecgh:

> The intent is for an external team to take up the mantle and build it, so it won't have any bearing on the current c0 roadmap.  The important thing to keep in mind is that the goal of Decred is to have a bunch of independent teams on working on different things.

How Decred is [not vulnerable](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1529127002000075) to SPV leaf/node attack.

Twitter: small [chat](https://twitter.com/AnselLindner/status/1003708357193150466) about Decred fork resistance, followed by discussion on [slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PBR19L4/p1528138824000839). Our community members continue to tirelessly educate about the workings of Decred hybrid system. Key takeaway from this chat is that Decred chain is impossible to advance without votes, and to get around that the forker needs to change it to the point when it's no longer Decred.
