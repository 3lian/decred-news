## Governance

{recap of decision-making activity, including new proposals, changes to proposals, voting, discussions, pre-proposal drafts, etc}

Part of November was reported in the previous issue due to late release.

@snr01 provided nice charts. People in #proposals and #research hacked on Politeia data.

Low quality proposals cluttering Politeia were disussed in depth and multiple ideas were suggested. @richardred gave a nice overview of this in Politeia Digest #4.

## Network

Hashrate: {start, end, low, high, variation; pool distribution}

Staking: {30-day average tix price, low, high, locked DCR million and % of avail supply}

After the price dropped to 97.1, 1,378 tickets were purchased in a single window that bumped the price to 110.2 after 9 subsequent price increases. This is the new all time high on new sdiff algorithm that is in effect since Jul 2017.

Nodes: {node counts, version distribution}

## Mining

The Whatsminer D1 [turned out](https://twitter.com/Pangolinminer/status/1061521332498624512) to be 48 TH/s, 9% up from expected 44 TH/s. The price is $4,850 [from Pangolin](https://pangolinminer.com/product/whatsminer-dcr-with-psu-shipout-on-dec-5/).

## Markets

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

Oct 14-15 BTC drop, most top 100 cryptoassets lost 10-20% together with the BTC dive to 5400 USDT / 5200 USD. This happened just a day before the BCH split.

## Relevant External

{PoW, ASIC resistance, tech}

{BCH Rust impl https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-community-introduced-to-new-bch-library-written-in-rust/}

According to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9sq0jj/shady_behavior_from_groestlcoin_grs_developers/), yet another coin with claimed ASIC resistance received an ASIC while the developers removed ASIC resistance claims from the website. Reddit thread that questioned this was [wiped out](https://archive.today/SzoHs). An instance where transparent censorship is missing. (_missed in Oct issue_)

A paper was [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8) in Nature Climate journal that suggests Bitcoin PoW mining will have significant negative impact on climate change. [Discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!NKtIRqGOEGaZvSQkKl:decred.org/$15412120277994HzToF:decred.org) in #random noted serious misunderstandings of how PoW works and alarmingly low quality of the paper, along with some guesses who and why could post it.

Zcash is [looking into](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/announcing-zcash-blossom-and-proposed-feature-goals/31891) hybrid ASIC-GPU mining, among other improvements planned for next year's protocol upgrade.

{governance, forks

{BCH forks
* Bitcoin Cash, born as a solution to disagreement with Bitcoin, is splitting into 2 chains (correct?). SV = Satoshi's Vision? Again?
* (does the community split or is it a horror story by the media?)
* explain 1) why they are forking, 2) vision and tech behind SV and ABC, 3) people, companies and capital behind both
* what has Cobra to do with it?
* https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2018/11/05/looming-fork-pushed-bitcoin-cash-up-almost-40-over-the-weekend-heres-why/
* https://news.bitcoin.com/discussions-intensify-as-bch-fork-approaches/
* nice overview https://medium.com/circle-research/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-report-4e4377d514a
  * both projects get individually weaker
  * SV is quite aggressive to ABC and hopes to dedicate some hashrate to mining empty blocks on the ABC chain (and not to secure the SV chain)
* nice high-level overview: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/when-fork-forks-what-you-need-know-bitcoin-cash-goes-war/
* https://cash.coin.dance/ nice site for following the "hash war"
* Live stream which ran for 8 hours with appearances from Vitalik, Emin Gun Sirer, others: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxeeQ_-QVNo
* Nice thread with resources https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9xasgg/bitcoin_cash_hard_fork_mega_thread/
* Poloniex [allowed](https://poloniex.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/1000270700-update-on-the-upcoming-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork) users to trade betwen both possible outcomes of the Bitcoin Cash fork. This led to the presence of _three_ tokens on the exchange: BCH, BCHABC nad BCHSV, with the latter two being 90% cheaper than BCH. Forks just keep spawning when you don't have a formal process to resolve disputes.
* It appears some forces are tearing apart Bitcoin Cash. Whatever they are, let us keep Decred resistant to them.
* contrast with how Decred works

Alternative way do resolve disputes: attack wrong chains

UK government canceled a stablecoin project based on a fork of btcd. [@alexbosworth] [noted](https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/1056318062176145414): "The thing about stablecoins is that one day someone can come along and cancel the whole thing.".

https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/1059791476102754305

> @andy_bromberg and @msantoriESQ discuss why ICOs are down 90% since the winter, why airdrops could be a better than ICOs for seeding usage on networks, whether or not they're legal and which wallets to target.

Regular security reminder: SMS, and relying on mobile operators in general, is bad choice for 2FA. Good to see lawsuits [like this](https://www.coindesk.com/victims-sue-att-t-mobile-over-sim-swap-crypto-hacks/) starting but they won't get your coins back. Speaking even more generally, most smartphones have a [baseband chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseband_processor) and other proprietary parts that nobody really knows what they are doing or how vulnerable they are. Keep your coins safe.
