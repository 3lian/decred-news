## Outreach

{overview of outreach/communications/marketing activity for past month and any short-term plans}

> We were equally as excited to see the engagement sparked by the CoinDesk article last weekend! It was certainly interesting to see various projects discussing who ended up being mentioned in the article, with only Decred and a handful of others making the cut. This type of coverage is the result of months of communication with reporters: education, timely responses, interviews, supplying information and statistics, etc. Stories like this don't happen overnight or of their own accord — and the old adage "out of sight, out of mind" does apply to media.

December's mining report from CoinShares notes a 80% Bitcoin hashrate increase since Jun 2019, from ~50 to ~90 Eh/s (Exahash per second). 70% of the ~40 Eh/s added is speculated to come from China, while China's share in the total hashrate is estimated 65%. The estimated "breakeven" and "miner capitulation" prices are estimated ~$6,100 and ~$3,900 respectively.
