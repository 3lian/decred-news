## Release v1.5.1

v1.5.1 fixes bugs found in v1.5.0 and adds a few features:

dcrd: fixed minor memory leak with authenticated RPC WebSocket clients on intermittent connections. This is especially relevant for setups that involve wallets with a very large number of addresses.

dcrwallet: fixed address reuse bug that could be triggered by restart of the network sync (e.g. when losing link to dcrd), a bug in ticket buyer that could send change to a wrong account, and a few other bugs. New features include the `auditreuse` command and the ability to use `createrawtransaction` in SPV syncing mode (i.e. without running dcrd).

Decrediton: fixed incorrect display of active tickets, gap exhaustion during change generation, and several UI issues. QR codes have been [sexed up](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2380) with blue/green Decred logo in the center.

Find the full release notes and downloads on the [release page](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.5.1). As always, [verify the binaries](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries/) before installation.

## Voting reminder

{still ~week to go}

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

Service script for OpenBSD rc.d [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2030) along [existing](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/release/services) systemd and SMF configs.

HTTP seeder support added [to dcrseeder](https://github.com/decred/dcrseeder/pull/25) and [to dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2017).

`chainec` package [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2039) because of the practical issues encountered with this generic crypto API.

Nonce generation [improved and optimized](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2044) by specializing the implementation specifically for secp256k1 and modifying it in such a way that signing can no longer fail in the extremely unlikely event a returned nonce results in an invalid signature.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

Multiple bug fixes for the v1.5.1 release.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

Lots of bug fixes and UI enhancements for the v1.5.1 release.

Work continues to [refactor startup](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2121) to utilize a hierarchical state machine.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

The Decred Contractor Clearance (DCC) component of the CMS has been launched and served a couple of first DCC issuances.

CMS received a bunch of fixes and UI enhancements.

Work continues on CMS UI [redesign](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1625) and adding dark mode to Politeia.

{ optionally add an intro about pi-ui: what is it, why, where does it stand }

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool):

dcrstakepool v1.5.0 was released. This release contains all development work completed since v1.2.0 (September 2019). Since then, 7 contributors have produced and merged 37 pull requests. Changes include minor GUI enhancements, improved HTTP request logging, some streamlining of existing code, and various bug fixes. For the full list of changes and upgrade path see the [release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/blob/master/docs/release-note-1.5.0.md).

A new high level design was [proposed](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/574) for removing VSP accounts that also removes fees from VSP ticket transactions, making it possible for both solo and VSP stakers to purchase mixed tickets in the same anonymity set. (_missed in Dec_)

[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool):

Large [refactoring](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/143) to decouple components and facilitate testing.

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

Docker examples [finished](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/66) that automate the deployment of simnet environments with docker-compose.

Beginner guide for testing Decred LN [published](https://medium.com/decred/beginner-guide-to-the-decred-dcr-lightning-network-917f8ad304aa) on Medium.

Bug fixes, documentation improvements.

Work continues to [port upstream changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/74) up to the recently released [v0.9.0-beta](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.9.0-beta) version. The ported changeset includes 503 commits that add 37K and remove 11K lines of code.

## Governance

CV progress https://explorer.dcrdata.org/agenda/headercommitments

In January the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 14,121 DCR and spent 15,560 DCR. Using January's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. At December's average daily rate of ${n.nn}, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is ${n}K. As of Feb 1, Treasury balance is 642,082 DCR (12.2 million USD at $18.96).

There were 6 proposals submitted in Jan, 5 have already been voted on and 1 is still under discussion.

* The proposal from [Monde]() Public Relations was approved with 72% approval and turnout of 25%.
* The proposal from [Ditto](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/012b4e335f25704e28ef196d650316dca421f730225d39e37b31b3c646eb8497) PR was rejected with 17% approval and turnout of 35%.
* The Decred Open Source Research Program renewal of [phase 3](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e3675649075a2f92269d8cdc2e1dfd71b16796477df31de7d2868cccfcffb13f) was approved with 82% approval and turnout of 29%.
* A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/063e38270b475ad680e98c12d1a48e322f4e8defe40b265272ea60c6d2202b13) from @dezyrth to manage the project's Facebook account and represent Decred at events was approved with 76% yes votes and participation of 21%.
* A proposal for [stickers](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4acb95564d36488a7ee64683a84dd7954982b2f4743e2f7a15477231f863442f) was rejected with 5% yes votes and participation of 21%.
* A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/95cfb73254a032b2c199c37bb499d6f172d044b1f38016279c5bbca6572251f0) by @exitus to produce video content for Decred is under discussion.

Politeia Digest [Issue 26](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue026/) has more detail on all of the proposals and the Market Maker auditing. Auditing tools have been developed which process i2's order open/close history to calculate uptime on a percentage basis. If uptime is less than the 90% quoted in i2's proposal, their fees for the month will be reduced proportionally.

Also in Jan, @jy-p prepared some numbers about the geographical reach of Decred Treasury spending which were featured in an [article](https://www.coindesk.com/is-bitcoin-in-2020-really-like-the-early-internet) on Coindesk: 

> To be fair, cryptocurrency has already proven its usefulness through cross-border collaboration. For example, the Decred treasury has distributed roughly $3.5 million worth of cryptocurrency to more than 60 contributors, according to the communityâ€™s press representative. Roughly 30 percent of these contributors hail from Latin America and 15 percent are from Africa, a more global distribution than comparable Silicon Valley startups.

## Outreach

{overview of outreach/communications/marketing activity for past month and any short-term plans}

> We were equally as excited to see the engagement sparked by the CoinDesk article last weekend! It was certainly interesting to see various projects discussing who ended up being mentioned in the article, with only Decred and a handful of others making the cut. This type of coverage is the result of months of communication with reporters: education, timely responses, interviews, supplying information and statistics, etc. Stories like this don't happen overnight or of their own accord â€” and the old adage "out of sight, out of mind" does apply to media.

Decred was featured in the new Our Network weekly newsletter issues [2](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-issue-2) and [6](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-issue-6), with @Checkmate providing charts and insights about Decred on chain data and Richard-Red providing one chart about Politeia. The newsletter includes 5 graphs and comments each week for a number of different blockchain projects. 

Checkmate made the bear case for Ethereum as part of an intended "[crypto rumble](https://bankless.substack.com/p/why-eth-wont-sustain-a-monetary-premium)" in the Bankless newsletter. Someone is supposed to write a rebuttal to his critique but the person who planned to do this has pulled out and a new challenger is being sought. Vitalik Buterin [responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ewb9as/why_eth_wont_sustain_a_monetary_premium/fg2x4oz) to some comments about the write-up on reddit, maybe he will take up the [challenge](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1223323007675961344).

## Markets

In January DCR was trading between USD 16.24-22.44 / BTC 0.00195-0.00257. The average daily rate was $18.00.

The price movement of Bitcoin from ~6500 to the ~9000 range spurred the price increase of a number of [altcoins](https://cointelegraph.com/news/dash-price-up-70-bsv-gains-200-is-a-price-correction-imminent) including Dash, Zcash and a number of Bitcoin forks.

December's mining report from CoinShares notes a 80% Bitcoin hashrate increase since Jun 2019, from ~50 to ~90 Eh/s (Exahash per second). 70% of the ~40 Eh/s added is speculated to come from China, while China's share in the total hashrate is estimated to be 65%. The estimated "breakeven" and "miner capitulation" prices are estimated ~$6,100 and ~$3,900 respectively.

[Nakamoto](https://nakamoto.com/), a new cryptocurrency-themed journal, launched on the 11th anniversary of Bitcoin's genesis block with a selection of articles from prominent blockchain personalities. The journal describes itself (and contributors) as being "pro-Bitcoin", but this caused quite a lot of [controversy](https://cryptoslate.com/nakamowho-blog-by-pro-bitcoin-technologists-bashed-by-btc-maximalists/) with some Bitcoin maximalists who took exception to articles which were about cryptocurrency projects other than Bitcoin. Many people listed as contributors have not yet [published](https://modernconsensus.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin-journal-nakamotos-rocky-start/) articles in the journal, but listing names like Roger Ver and Brendan Blumer (Block.one CEO) seems to have been enough to have other contributors like Tuur Demeester [withdrawing](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1213939900476743680) their name. 

DigixDAO is to be wound down following a [vote](https://www.coindesk.com/digixdao-votes-to-liquidate-64m-treasury) in which 58 stakeholders voted [overwhelmingly](https://community.digix.global/#/proposals/0xe7d5d8aefc5f73c4c8bbc716f0c3c2dd52d5282d18217db331da4435b8e6966e) (97%) to liquidate its funding pool and reclaim their ETH. DigixDAO was formed to support an ecosystem around the Digix gold token (DGX) and promote it. Digix [conducted](https://www.coindesk.com/digixdao-votes-to-liquidate-64m-treasury) an ICO in 2016 and raised 466,648 ETH, worth $7 million at the time, and currently holds 380,000 ETH (worth $71 million at Jan 2019 prices). After the DAO platform launched in March 2019 to administer the fund the founders began to hear dissatisfaction from DAO members and requests for dissolution. They introduced [Project Ragnarok](https://community.digix.global/#/proposals/0xe7d5d8aefc5f73c4c8bbc716f0c3c2dd52d5282d18217db331da4435b8e6966e) as an option to dissolve the DAO and allow members to reclaim their ETH, and members took that option. Of the DAO token (DGD) circulating supply of 2 million, 1 million was staked to participate in DAO governance. Casual inspection of the proposals on the DigixDAO community [site](https://community.digix.global/#/) suggests turnout in proposal votes was regularly lower than 10% DGD represented, with around 20-30 voters on most proposals. The liquidation proposal had much higher participation, with 66% of circulating DGD voting to shut the whole thing down.

Decentraland are putting their Agora governance platform to use again with [two](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/back-to-the-polls-two-new-agora-votes/) more votes to determine ecosystem parameters. MANA holders voted on what the marketplace [fee](https://agora.decentraland.org/polls/1d955723-5158-4403-b026-32e974e2fae9) should be (fees are collected in MANA and burned), with 90% voting to increase the fee from 1% to 2.5% (the other options were for larger increases). MANA holders also voted on how much weight to give [LAND](https://agora.decentraland.org/polls/0387cebc-31a3-4e12-a7b4-e9926dd5b392) ownership in governance, having previously voted to indicate that LAND owners should also be able to vote, in this poll the MANA holders voted to give each land the equivalent voting power to 2k MANA (the lowest option available). Participation in these governance polls was around 3.5-4% of circulating MANA supply.

The Zcash development funding saga seems to finally be [over](https://electriccoin.co/blog/dev-fund-poll-shows-consensus/), for this epoch. However not before having to resolve some final disagreements. The first of these was about whether the ECC's funding should be capped in USD terms (limiting ECC's exposure to ZEC upside). The ECC published a [post](https://electriccoin.co/blog/dev-funds-should-be-in-zcash-not-united-states-dollars/) about the importance of ZEC-denominated incentive packages for attracting and retaining talented workers, with a 4 year vesting schedule on these to encourage long service. The post argued against a fiat-denominated cap on ECC's earnings, as it would break this incentive alignment by reducing ECC's exposure to ZEC upside. This was one of the questions put to long-standing forum members in a [poll](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zip-1014-poll-results/), the [results](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/43b9bec8-39a1-11ea-914c-b6e34ffa859a/view) of which indicated that 56 did not want a cap while 18 did. Voters also opted to limit ECC's share of rewards to 35%, the smallest of the options presented. All that remains is for the Zcash Foundation and ECC to finalize the details of the agreement, and 20% of the ZEC rewards will be going to the ECC (35%), Zcash Foundation (25%) and major grants (as decided by a panel selected by the Foundation, 40%) - until the next halvening epoch, when the dance begins anew.

A related disagreement as part of this final round of polling was about the importance of holding a coin holder vote. This involved [two](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/121) [comprehensive](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/community-sentiment-polling-results-nu4-and-draft-zip-1014/35560/375) discussions on the ZEC forum (nice to see Decred [mentioned](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/210), there seems to be a contingent of the ZEC community who would like to move to a Decred-style approach). In the end the coin vote turned into more of a discussion, as can be seen in this dashboard (warning: Google drive [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSlHXhA_NoJy0RW3Gc6YY3bmYcKT_YF8oS_BrSkBnvEGGaJ56WYo7iL_9shuoh-z_DZMYojA6FpLoJv/pubhtml)).

Round 4 of the Gitcoin Quadratic Funding experiment happened, and this [writeup](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/01/28/round4.html) by Vitalik Buterin gives an account of how it went. This round added a Media grants stream, with a smaller matching budget ($75,000) than the main Tech grants stream ($125,000). In the early stages @antiprosynth, a prominent Ethereum twitter personality, was in line to receive $20,000 in matching funds, but after some campaigning about this other initiatives received more donations and the share of matching funds for this twitter account was reduced to $11,393. There was some further [controversy](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1217894717909848067) in the Media grants category as one of the projects involved a private group that would get privileged access to the outputs. The main beneficiary in the Tech grants category was Tornado.cash, a smart-contract based ETH mixer.

Jiang Zhuoer revealed a [plan](https://medium.com/@jiangzhuoer/infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-131fdcd2412e) to fund development of Bitcoin Cash software with 12.5% of the BCH block reward. This would be enforced for all miners by a majority of mining power, and in its initial form would have channelled all funding to a specified company. After pushback from some in the BCH community a revised [version](https://read.cash/@Jiang_Zhuoer_BTC.TOP_CEO/bch-miner-donation-plan-update-a45daad6) of the plan was published. In this new version miners will choose which of a set of pre-approved development projects to donate the 12.5% of their block rewards to. If a miner does not like any of the available options they can choose to burn that portion of their rewards instead of donating. The post also seems to suggest reducing the donation rate from 12.5% to 2-3%, and makes it clear that the details of the plan are still open to discussion. There will be a round of hashrate voting before implementation, and an interim Foundation to receive donations from miners and others, who will have votes in proportion to their donated funds.

After years of delays to Dash Evolution (a suite of usability changes like user names and address books), a version of this now called Dash Platform was [released](https://dashnews.org/long-awaited-dash-evolution-platform-released-on-testnet-with-developer-documentation-hub/) on a public testnet.

A European Central Bank [working paper](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2351~c8c18bbd60.en.pdf?9bd63a4ddea2300dca05f2ccaa08c0e0) has indicated that the ECB would need to control the volume being used of any Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). One [analysis](https://cointelegraph.com/news/europe-central-bank-proposes-unattractive-rates-for-digital-currency) of the paper suggested that unattractive rates would be set for large holdings to discourage heavy use of the digital currency. One concern about heavy use of a CBDC would be that holders could move their funds outside the ECB's jurisdiction more easily in times of crisis.

Perpetrators of the PlusToken scam are [still](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/plustoken-scam-bitcoin-price) churning and selling the ill-gotten 180,000 BTC from their ponzi scheme. Although 6 people have been arrested in connection with PlusToken, the funds are still moving and being sold through OTC trades on Huobi [apparently](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/plustoken-scam-bitcoin-price) - possibly affecting the BTC price. The scammers' tokens are being tracked despite their use of mixing and 24,000 transactions involving 71,000 addresses to try and make this difficult - because they re-used an address. While an estimated $185 million worth of the BTC has been sold, 790k ETH of a total 800k remains untouched.

The custodial bitcoin wallet provider Bottle Pay [shut down](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-app-bottle-pay-shuts-down-over-impending-eu-money-laundering-laws) in December, citing the AMLD5 EU regulation coming into effect Jan 10, 2020. From the [announcement](https://bottlepay.helpscoutdocs.com/article/40-official-announcement-on-the-shutdown-of-bottle-pay): "The amount and type of extra personal information we would be required to collect from our users would alter the current user experience so radically, and so negatively, that we are not willing to force this onto our community.". Standing by the principles and shutting down is the opposite of doing [whatever it takes](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/shapeshift-cryptocurrency-exchange-kyc/) to keep the business afloat. The case can serve as a yet another signal to focus on improving self-custodial crypto software.
