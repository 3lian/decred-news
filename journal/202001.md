## Governance

CV progress https://explorer.dcrdata.org/agenda/headercommitments

In January the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 14,121 DCR and spent 15,560 DCR. Using January's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. At December's average daily rate of ${n.nn}, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is ${n}K. As of Feb 1, Treasury balance is 642,082 DCR (12.2 million USD at $18.96).

There were 6 proposals submitted in Jan, 5 have already been voted on and 1 is still under discussion.

* The proposal from [Monde]() Public Relations was approved with 72% approval and turnout of 25%.
* The proposal from [Ditto](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/012b4e335f25704e28ef196d650316dca421f730225d39e37b31b3c646eb8497) PR was rejected with 17% approval and turnout of 35%.
* The Decred Open Source Research Program renewal of [phase 3](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e3675649075a2f92269d8cdc2e1dfd71b16796477df31de7d2868cccfcffb13f) was approved with 82% approval and turnout of 29%.

{check if permabull and ammarooni posted their final pieces - if so, it means they finished delivering and is worth noting here}



Politeia Digest [Issue 26](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue026/) has more detail on all of the proposals and the Market Maker auditing. 

Also in Jan, @jy-p prepared some numbers about the geographical reach of Decred Treasury spending which were featured in an [article](https://www.coindesk.com/is-bitcoin-in-2020-really-like-the-early-internet) on Coindesk: 

> To be fair, cryptocurrency has already proven its usefulness through cross-border collaboration. For example, the Decred treasury has distributed roughly $3.5 million worth of cryptocurrency to more than 60 contributors, according to the community’s press representative. Roughly 30 percent of these contributors hail from Latin America and 15 percent are from Africa, a more global distribution than comparable Silicon Valley startups. 



## Network

{cross-check dcrdata.org, dcrstats.com and charts.dcr.farm to get the numbers}

Hashrate: January's hashrate opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate distribution as of {date}: {pool name n%, ...} per [dcrstats.com](https://dcrstats.com/pow). Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

{helpful for PoS: https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000003/proof-of-stake?orgId=1&from=now-40d&to=now }

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}) per dcrstats.com. The price varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR. Locked amount was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, which corresponded to {n.n}-{n.n}% of the available supply.

{recap of ticket price action if it was interesting}

{helpful for nodes: https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=now-40d&to=now }

Nodes: As of {date} there were {n} public listening nodes and {n} normal nodes per {new source?}. Version distribution: {vx.y.z: n% (+n%), ...}.

{any interesting analysis or events in the network}

Data from a node that was running since block 0 [shows]() that Decred mainnet chain had 2517 reorgs of depth 1, 25 reorgs of depth 2, 3 reorgs of depth 3, and 0 reorgs of depth >3.

## Outreach

{overview of outreach/communications/marketing activity for past month and any short-term plans}

> We were equally as excited to see the engagement sparked by the CoinDesk article last weekend! It was certainly interesting to see various projects discussing who ended up being mentioned in the article, with only Decred and a handful of others making the cut. This type of coverage is the result of months of communication with reporters: education, timely responses, interviews, supplying information and statistics, etc. Stories like this don't happen overnight or of their own accord — and the old adage "out of sight, out of mind" does apply to media.

Checkmate made the bear case for Ethereum as part of an intended "[crypto rumble](https://bankless.substack.com/p/why-eth-wont-sustain-a-monetary-premium)" in the Bankless newsletter. Someone is supposed to write a rebuttal to his critique but the person who planned to do this has pulled out and a new challenger is being sought. Vitalik Buterin [responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ewb9as/why_eth_wont_sustain_a_monetary_premium/fg2x4oz) to some comments about the write-up on reddit, maybe he will take up the [challenge](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1223323007675961344).

December's mining report from CoinShares notes a 80% Bitcoin hashrate increase since Jun 2019, from ~50 to ~90 Eh/s (Exahash per second). 70% of the ~40 Eh/s added is speculated to come from China, while China's share in the total hashrate is estimated 65%. The estimated "breakeven" and "miner capitulation" prices are estimated ~$6,100 and ~$3,900 respectively.

The custodial bitcoin wallet provider Bottle Pay [shut down](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-app-bottle-pay-shuts-down-over-impending-eu-money-laundering-laws) in December, citing the AMLD5 EU regulation coming into effect Jan 10, 2020. From the [announcement](https://bottlepay.helpscoutdocs.com/article/40-official-announcement-on-the-shutdown-of-bottle-pay): "The amount and type of extra personal information we would be required to collect from our users would alter the current user experience so radically, and so negatively, that we are not willing to force this onto our community.". Standing by the principles and shutting down is the opposite of doing [whatever it takes](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/shapeshift-cryptocurrency-exchange-kyc/) to keep the business afloat. The case can serve as a yet another signal to focus on improving self-custodial crypto software.
