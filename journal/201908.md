## Governance

In August the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {n} DCR and spent {n} DCR. Using August's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in July, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the July average daily rate of ${n.nn} - in which case the USD spent figure is ${n}K. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {n} DCR ({n.nn} million USD at ${n.nn}).

* revamped [contributing](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md) page, 
* [content plan](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/content.md) with ideas for expansion
* huge guidelines doc that captures the vision and ways of DJ is [under construction](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/pull/91)

## Markets

In August DCR was trading between USD {n.nn}-{n.nn} / BTC {}-{}. The average daily rate was ${n.nn}.

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

In context of discussing market maker proposals, [CoinMarketBook](https://coinmarketbook.cc/) argues "Market cap is a lie. Buy support tells the true story". As of 2019-08-19, DCR is #95 in that rating with only $260K of buy support at 10% distance from highest bid price. For context: BTC has $360M, ETH $55M, LTC $23M, XMR $9.5M, DASH $5.7M, DOGE $4.6M.
