## Governance

In August the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {n} DCR and spent {n} DCR. Using August's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${n.nn}, this is ${n}K received and ${n}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in July, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the July average daily rate of ${n.nn} - in which case the USD spent figure is ${n}K. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {n} DCR ({n.nn} million USD at ${n.nn}).

## Media

{community efforts: Decred Assembly, websites, etc}

Since April there have been a transfer of knowledge about DJ production in order to make it more "decentralized". As a result, several documents were created:

* self-describing [template](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/journal-template.md)
* revamped [contributing](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md) page, 
* [content plan](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/content.md) with ideas for expansion
* huge guidelines doc that captures the vision and ways of DJ is [under construction](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/pull/91)

## Community Discussions

Comm systems news:

* Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/coppup/i_did_a_review_of_the_powpos_mechanism_used_in/) was removed where the author tried to get exposure for his project by posting a low effort review of how Decred's hybrid PoW+PoS does not work. Our moderation is transparent thanks to publicmodlogs {link}
* More impostors were detected in Telegram that promise to help with your technical problem for a modest 0.05 BTC. Beware the scammers.
* Yet another attention attack: question received a proper answer and was quickly deleted https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cvrddy/raising_the_limit_of_coins/ . It was "undeleted", but this pattern more and more discourages knowledgeable people from participating on the platform.

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

In context of discussing market maker proposals, [CoinMarketBook](https://coinmarketbook.cc/) argues "Market cap is a lie. Buy support tells the true story". As of 2019-08-19, DCR is #95 in that rating with only $260K of buy support at 10% distance from highest bid price. For context: BTC has $360M, ETH $55M, LTC $23M, XMR $9.5M, DASH $5.7M, DOGE $4.6M.

Australia is [considering](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-20/transacting-$10,000-or-more-in-cash-could-make-you-a-criminal/11429230) to ban cash payments to businesses larger than $10K, affecting major purchases like cars, housing, and such. This will not apply to individual-to-individual transactions. Commenters noted that this can be abused as a tool to implement negative interest rates, on top of standard surveillance concerns.
