{idea: standalone "ad-hoc" section with short overview of the concept + all links to follow up}

{is before Dev a good place?}

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

New module named `blockchain/standalone` was [introduced](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1808), which aims to provide several of the standalone functions currently available in the `blockchain` module. The primary goal of offering these functions via a separate module is to reduce dependencies for client code. It will also be beneficial for applications such as lightweight clients that need to ensure basic security properties hold and calculate appropriate vote subsidies and block explorers. Opportunity was taken to write more robust and performant functions that will replace ones in the `blockchain` module in the next major version. The new module will ship with comprehensive tests, full package documentation, and basic usage examples.

The gradual process of upgrading Go modules continues with new versions of [`blockchain`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1823), [`mining`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1831), [`connmgr`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1833), [`peer`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1834) and [`mempool`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1835) being introduced to make use of previous module upgrades. The main module was also [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1837) to use all of the latest major module versions.

{ looks like main module was reached, does this mark the end of the module upgrading saga? if yes, any comments about the whole process (e.g. what does it allow to do)? }

`gcs` module received multiple [improvements](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+merged%3A2019-08-01..2019-08-31+gcs) to bring it to the quality level required by consensus code for ultimate inclusion in [header commitments](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58). Support has been [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1854) for independent false positive rate and Golomb coding bin size. Among other things, this permits more optimal parameters for minimizing the filter size to be specified. This capability will be used in the upcoming version 2 filters that will ultimately be included in header commitments. Start of the v2 dev cycle also marked the start of a [new approach](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1843) towards handling module versioning between release cycles to reduce the maintenance burden.

The Blake256 implementation has been [copied](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1811) into the dcrd repository so that dcrd does not have that external dependency anymore. While the optimizations required by dcrd were [accepted](https://github.com/dchest/blake256/pull/3) upstream, it is still desirable to have consensus critical code under tight control of dcrd maintainers to avoid situations mentioned [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1810).

Test coverage was increased and hardened in multiple areas of the codebase.

{ is address discovery notable? what's the user benefit? https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1522 }

Work [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1829) to maximize block template fees based on transaction chains in the mempool.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

A new [RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1522) has been added that allows the user to abandon (or remove) an unconfirmed transaction from the wallet, and any other transactions dependent on its outputs. Another new RPC allows export of the [extended private key](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1533) of an account after unlocking the wallet.

Code maintenance: updated to use the new modules in dcrd and [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1531) usages of old modules, [improved](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1539) compatibility with Go 1.13 errors.

Work has begun to add [support](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1541) for creating CoinJoin transactions for purchasing split transactions in ticket buying, as well as mixing of individual mix change outputs into smaller standard denominations.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): UI tweaks, bug fixes, code cleanup. 

Initial [dark mode](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2089) has been [completed](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2163). Work continues on making the UI responsive, with four new responsive views [added](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2174).

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

Work on the Politeia redesign is proceeding at pace, with a [number](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1356) [of](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1338) [PRs](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/1360) merged that add existing functionality to the redesigned interface. On the backend, significant work laying the foundations for the [DCC process](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4), to be incorporated in the CMS, has been [merged](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/980).

The question of how to support RFP type proposals on Politeia has been the subject of discussion in this [issue](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/966) and in #politeia. There will be a new RFP type proposal which candidate proposals can link to, voting and determining the options/outcome will be controlled through these RFP proposals. Before opening an RFP proposal, an ordinary proposal asking "should we have this RFP" would be submitted and approved - the 2 "RFP proposals" Politeia has seen thus far are of this type. The main point of discussion about the new RFP type proposals is around whether these should be conducted as multiple-choice proposals (where voters can vote for 1-of-N options and one with the most votes wins) or as parallel proposals where tickets can vote yes/no on each proposal and the winner is the one with the highest yes less no votes aggregate score (as the MM RFP is being conducted). Parallel voting on competing proposals seems to be the priority, with multiple-choice voting likely to come later and be used for a different purpose (more like polling).

Login by username was switched back to email to prevent [targeted locking](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/860#issuecomment-520871500) of accounts. [2FA](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/544) will solve this issue and allow logins without email.

[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex): The dcrdex repository was [announced](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1156652694502817793) in July to house the DEX [specification](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/tree/master/spec), and the first substantive PRs on the software are already [open](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/17). A new [#dexdev](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!EzTSRQITaqHuFBDFhM:decred.org) room was also created for DEX development chat on Matrix. 

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool):

The large [effort](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+227) to [decouple](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/227) dcrstakepool from dcrwallet started in April has finally come to [completion](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/470). This change decreases code complexity and reduces the quantity of RPC calls over the network, which in turn enhances performance and increases security.

VSP operators gained support for SMTPS to send registration and account recovery emails via encrypted connections (including [self-signed certificates](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/486)), improved [status page](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/484) and better error reporting.

tmux [test harness](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/476) has been added to boost productivity of testing.

[30 PRs](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+merged%3A2019-08-01..2019-08-31) were merged in total.

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd):

{ looks like something was merged in Aug, what's the overview of changes? https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/commits/master }

More of upstream lnd work was [ported](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/36#issuecomment-526721084) and is being tested before merging in dcrlnd. A total of 400+ PRs and 1700+ lines of code were adjusted. { keep or group with bigger report next month? }

> to keep in sync we needed to adapt pretty much every single commit after our merge point on Jan 10 ([@matheusd](https://twitter.com/matheusd_tech/status/1169194706636615680))

LN faucet gained a form to [pay invoices](https://github.com/decred/lightning-faucet/pull/8) and new config [parameters](https://github.com/decred/lightning-faucet/pull/14).

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): Work is being done to implement the [new UI](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/400) which will bring the app into alignment with the standard app design recommendations for Android. Work on the backend is also ongoing for [multi-wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/188) support which will enable [read only](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/393) wallets for ticket monitoring.

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): Work is in progress on the improved UI and watch-only wallet support similar to the Android app.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): consume upgrades in dcrd, UI tweaks, optimizations and bug fixes.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): [Added](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/968) new page detailing [atomic swaps](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/atomic-swap/), [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/979) [hardware wallet](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/hardware-wallets/) support info, minor cleanups.

Work has started on a long asked for separate [developer documentation](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/135) site. Initial work is occurring in a personal repo that will be moved under the main Decred GitHub org when the site is launched.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): Roadmap has been [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/695) with new developments, the [press coverage page](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/706) was updated with recent coverage, and privacy has been [added](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/712) to the homepage and roadmap.

## Governance

In August the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 15,278 DCR and spent 8,223 DCR. Using August's daily average DCR/USD rate of $26.23, this is $401K received and $216K spent. As these payments were for work completed in July, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the July average daily rate of $28.97 - in which case the USD spent figure is $238K. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {n} DCR ({n.nn} million USD at ${n.nn}).

A DEX development [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1) from @chappjc and @buck54321 (who work on dcrdata), with support from Company 0, was submitted, and approved with 90% Yes votes. This proposal has an estimated cost of $230,000 to deliver a command-line interface application, which can be extended by future proposals to offer a user interface using the Electron Framework.

The decredcommunity proposals [repository](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals) has an [index](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/dex/index.md) of DEX-related material.

3 Market Maker proposals were published on Aug 7, from [Altonomy](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60), [i2 Trading](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9) and [Grapefruit Trading](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b). After a few days of discussion the dominant topic was whether the Treasury should be used to hire market makers at all. @jz submitted an [RFP proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd) to establish whether the stakeholders wanted to hire a designated market maker in principle. The proposal explained the process which @jz, @maxbronstein and Chris Burniske had undertaken prior to the submission of the proposals - and made a case for approving one of these proposals. The RFP proposal also clarified the terms of the vote (a maximum of 1 market maker proposal can be approved and it must meet the usual criteria). 

Altonomy submitted a proposal to offer $50k each side on 10 pairs, they were actively engaged on Politeia and provided answers to many questions, but on Aug 16 they withdrew their proposal, editing it to say "Sorry, due to our technical capacity, we decided to withdraw this proposal."

i2 Trading submitted a proposal to offer $50k each side on 6 pairs, they engaged actively on Politeia and in the #proposals channel, answering the majority of questions. In response to concerns about transparency, i2 offered to allow a Decred representative read-only access to their exchange accounts for limited periods of time. i2 made a number of edits to their proposal, to add a note about providing API access, clarify the borrowing need and terms, and then amending their offer to loosen the spreads, reduce the maximum fees per month to $10k/month, and drop the fees from $40k/month to $35k/month.

Grapefruit started with 2 offers in their proposal (both for $30k each side on 4 pairs), one with a tighter spread that would cost $40k/month in fees and one with a looser spread that would cost $28k/month in fees. @grapefruittrading answered questions on Politeia on Aug 8 and 20, ignoring some questions while offering [substantive](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/6) [replies](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/5) to others. Before authorizing voting to start, @grapefruittrading edited their proposal to remove the more expensive offer, choosing to run with the less expensive offer as they perceived a demand for that from stakeholders and it was their preferred option anyway. 

i2 and Grapefruit authorized voting to begin on their proposals on Aug 27. 

Tantra Labs submitted a [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/82ce113827140caaaf8b5779ab30402d3ed39f1911fdd2e8fa64cf0dc9e09ecb) on Aug 28 which offered a very different proposition, $30k each side at up to 3% spread on 6 ([or 7](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/82ce113827140caaaf8b5779ab30402d3ed39f1911fdd2e8fa64cf0dc9e09ecb/comments/8)) pairs, with no fees being charged to the Treasury. Instead, the Treasury would only be charged for the cost of borrowing the inventory and up to $10k/month in trading fees. Tantra offered to allow a Decred representative to have read-only access to their exchange accounts to "elected" Decred representatives, so that the promised availability of liquidity can be verified. Tantra also propose providing a web interface offering an interface to a set of open source order book transparency tools. 

Much of the discussion of Tantra's proposal concerns whether it is too good to be true, with a number of people expressing their doubts that Tantra could deliver what they propose, and wondering if the low cost comes with hidden downsides. Tantra have been active in #proposals and have answered some of the questions on Politeia. Some members of the community grew inpatient waiting for Tantra to authorize the start of voting, illuminating an issue with RFP proposals being slowed down out by late submissions, and highlighting the value of a defined timetable.

A fourth [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c9604f7879e4b2cd4f2582d238a7ccea210005c63481bec1ddae44ff93e1340f) about market making, submitted by @betterfuture, was published on Aug 31. This proposes a scheme for incentivizing market makers to provide liquidity on specific pairs without a firm commitment. The proposal describes rules and penalties for keeping participants in line, and would require a trusted intermediary representing the Decred project to audit the activities of the market makers. @jz was nominated for this role in the proposal, but he has [stated](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c9604f7879e4b2cd4f2582d238a7ccea210005c63481bec1ddae44ff93e1340f/comments/5) that he would not wish to take it on. Deliberation and refinement of this proposal is being viewed as a long term effort by its proponents, and it will not be competing with the other proposals.

Voting commenced for the 3 market maker proposals on Sep 4.

For a more detailed consideration of the market maker proposals and other Politeia activity, check out Politeia Digest issues [20](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/politeia-digest/blob/master/issue-020.md) (Aug 1-12) and [21](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/politeia-digest/blob/master/issue-021.md) (Aug 13-31). There are also a number of community-produced resources which aim to help people who are new to the idea of market making to understand it, and which make comparisons between the different proposals.

- an index of all notable documents and discussions related to market makers is maintained [here](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/market-makers/index.md)
- [comparison table](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/market-makers/comparison.md) which aims to compare the proposals in terms of their offers and costs
- @bee has written up a comprehensive [overview](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/market-makers/arguments.md) of the discussion in relation to specific questions and arguments, and also a detailed [dissection](https://github.com/xaur/writings/blob/master/20190822-dissection-market-makers-for-decred.md) of the subject, introducing relevant terms and presenting an overview of the key considerations.
- @exitus has produced a [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKSMA-eanoY) of the proposals.

Following discussion in the #research channel, @richard-red began collecting order book data for a selection of pairs and exchanges in this [repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/exchange-data). The objective is to build a better picture of how the order books for DCR and selected other cryptoassets currently look, and an initial report has been prepared ahead of the voting on market maker proposals. This data will also be useful for tracking the order books over time to observe the effect of a market maker, should one be hired. Order book data will likely be added to dcrdata's external data offering at some stage, but the nature of this data is such that it can only be recorded live, the only sources of historical order book data are proprietary and [expensive](https://www.kaiko.com/products/binance-10-order-books). 

It is worth mentioning the Decred community proposals [repository](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals), where a number of the above resources can be found. This repository was created as a place to collect the information that emerges from discussion and analysis of proposals. 

{market makers: cover how owners engaged with the community and adjusted proposals in response to feedback}

A reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cutc16/decred_events_meetups_in_the_cis_in_20192020/) was submitted which is intended to serve as a pre-proposal for funding of Decred events and meetups in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - specifically Russia, Ukraine and Georgia.

## Outreach

Much of the in-process Outreach work was pushed aside, as we focused on the release of Decred Privacy. Efforts began on August 21st, as Project Lead, Jake Yocom-Piatt published [Surveying the Privacy Landscape](https://blog.decred.org/2019/08/21/Surveying-the-Privacy-Landscape/). This work was supported via [tweet storm](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1164245224274767873?s=20) which generated direct engagement from Fluffy Pony, Zooko, and the Mimblewimble folks. The first details of Privacy broke when International Operations Lead, Jonathan Zeppettini, went on [Laura Shin's Unchained Podcast](https://unchainedpodcast.com/after-years-of-secret-work-decred-adds-a-new-feature-privacy/) to talk about Decred and its new feature.

Twenty-four hours later, the first written news of Decred Privacy was released by The Block, in concert with the publication of Jake's article, [Iterating Privacy](https://blog.decred.org/2019/08/28/Iterating-Privacy/), which deeply explored the motivations, operational details, limitations, and next steps of Decred Privacy. This was supported with a [10-part tweet storm](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1166746979160023046?s=20), which garnered lots of attention and engagement. Decred's Privacy implementation has been received heavy coverage, detailed in Media, with the excpetion of Coindesk. 

To continue support of the Privacy release, Anshawblack released [Privacy Flow](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1169011789255925762?s=20), with GhostRhidah, and also a very special [Decred in Depth episode featuring Jake Yocom-Piatt](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1168558002867191808?s=20) just days after the release. In this episode, Jake delves deeply into the surveillance economy, why privacy matters, and the current and future states of Decred Privacy.

At the time of publication, the Ditto team continues to work on ways to keep Decred Privacy top of mind, and it seems like a timely issue with [recent news of Google wrongdoing.](https://www.ft.com/content/e3e1697e-ce57-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f) Additionally, Dustorf will soon publish a blog entry on Medium targeting the less technical crowd.

Outreach has made a concerted effort to increase engagement on twitter via quality content and education regarding Decred. This was demonstrated by project impression counts more than doubling from July to over 5.6MM. One of the messages that gained the most amount of traction was [a 4-paart tweet storm on the announcement of the DEX specs](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1156652694502817793?s=20)

Decred has confirmed it's booth presence at [Websummit](https://websummit.com/), November 4-7, in Lisbon, Portugal, so please connect with us in the events_planning room in Matrix if you're interesting in helping out. We're also planning a roadshow in Asia, but don't have any details to share at the time of publication.

[Foundational Messaging](https://github.com/decredcommunity/pr/blob/release/foundational-messaging.md) was updated to v2. [Changes](https://github.com/decredcommunity/pr/commit/fc407b8f037a222db22a4507e4a5ade5b746f4dd) include Pitch, Tagline and Vision expanded with Decred's principles and a FAQ. Tagline was slightly tweaked to replace "Self-Funding" with "Sustainable".

## Media

Since April the Decred Journal has been pushing for greater decentralization of its production, this has involved writing down descriptions of how components of the Journal get made and the reasoning for making them in these ways. The idea is that by formalizing these aspects the Journal becomes less reliant on the individuals who currently contribute, and their tacit knowledge. The following documents are available, worth a look for anyone who would like to become a Journal contributor.

* self-describing [template](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/journal-template.md)
* revamped [contributing](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md) page, 
* [content plan](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/content.md) with ideas for expansion
* huge guidelines doc that captures the vision and ways of DJ is [under construction](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/pull/91)

## Community Discussions

Comm systems news:

* Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/coppup/i_did_a_review_of_the_powpos_mechanism_used_in/) was removed where the author tried to get exposure for his project by posting a low effort review of how Decred's hybrid PoW+PoS does not work. Our moderation is transparent thanks to publicmodlogs {link}
* Yet another case where a [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cvrddy/raising_the_limit_of_coins/) received a proper answer and was quickly deleted. It was "undeleted", but the deletion of the original post caused the answer to lose visibility. This pattern discourages knowledgeable people from putting in the effort to answer questions on reddit. In this case the question poster actually [apologized](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cvwmsz/raising_the_limit_of_coins_undelete/ey7p6qr) for deleting their post in the "undeleted" repost.
* More impostors were detected in Telegram that promise to help with your technical problem for a modest 0.05 BTC. Beware the scammers.

## Markets

In August DCR was trading between USD 22.63-32.17 / BTC 0.00275-0.00227. The average daily rate was $26.23.

Bitcoin has again been oscillating around the 10,000$ mark most of August briefly hitting 12,200 USD. Many are speculating that the upcoming launch of ["Bakkt"](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-will-bakkts-launch-this-month-take-btc-to-new-highs) will make bitcoin break this cycle.

In context of discussing market maker proposals, [CoinMarketBook](https://coinmarketbook.cc/) argues "Market cap is a lie. Buy support tells the true story". As of 2019-08-19, DCR is #95 in that rating with only $260K of buy support at 10% distance from highest bid price. For context: BTC has $360M, ETH $55M, LTC $23M, XMR $9.5M, DASH $5.7M, DOGE $4.6M.

## Relevant External

Blockstream have [announced](https://blockstream.com/2019/08/08/en-mining-launch/) their Bitcoin mining operations (which started in 2017), with sites in Quebec and Georgia that host their own machines plus those of their clients. Blockstream also announced a new mining pool, the first production mining pool to use the [BetterHash](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/betterhash-protocol-lets-pool-miners-regain-control-over-their-hash-power) protocol. BetterHash allows individual miners to choose which transactions to include in the 

Braiins have [announced](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/with-stratum-v2-braiins-plans-big-overhaul-in-pooled-bitcoin-mining) that the open source Stratum mining protocol V2 will incorporate similar functionality inspired by BetterHash, allowing pools to be configured such that miners choose transactions and version bits for their proposals directly. 

The Zcash community continues to wrestle with the decision about how to fund development after the founders' reward ceases to channel 20% of block rewards to the ECC, Zcash Foundation and other beneficiaries. There follow some short descriptions of seemingly relevant posts - following this process is quite effortful, so it is possible important items have been missed.

The Zcash Foundation (ZF) has [posted](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/dev-fund-guidance-and-timeline/) to make its position clear, their preferred option is mandatory funding of a dev fund by block reward, with the stipulation that all entities receiving these funds must be not-for-profit. The ECC is presently an ordinary corporation, dedicated to the profit of its shareholders, whose interests could conflict with the health of the network. This is a common theme to much of the discussion, people are not keen on block rewards going to a for-profit company and possibly enriching founders/investors.

ZF's less preferred options are opt-in funding by miners (who would choose whether to donate or burn funds, and who to donate them to) and no dev funding. Zcash foundation has a projected burn rate of $3.7mm/year ($2mm being wages), and could operate at this level until 2023, after which point it would need alternative funding.

The Zcash Foundation is organizing a Community Governance Panel, which individuals [could](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1166819884669341697) sign up on twitter. Outcomes of the panel are [not binding](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/governance-results/).

The ECC released a [Transparency Report](https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Transparency-report-Q3-2019-2.pdf) which breaks down the ECC's income and outgoings during Q1 2019. ECC's effective burn rate was $635k/month in Q1, and the company holds $6.4M worth of USD and Zcash. The company had an income of $449k in Q1.

Other proposals include a [grand compromise](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-grand-compromise-synthesis-zip-proposal/34812) from Josh Cincinnati of the Zcash Foundation, which would instigate another 4 years of 20% block rewards, shared between EFF and ZF, with the release of 8% (4% for ECC and 4% for ZF) contingent on greater adoption of shielded transactions. 

[Strategic Council Proposal](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/dev-fund-proposal-strategic-council-approach/34801), which would see a continued 20% of block rewards and a board of 5 people making decisions about how it is spent. This comes from avichal, a serial entrepreneur and founder of Electric Capital, which invests in a number of layer 1 protocols (but not Zcash). 

James Prestwich has a [proposal](https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1165390624171986944?s=20) (in a Google doc) which criticizes the management of ECC and takes exception to the ECC using its funds to conduct marketing campaigns which aim to generate support for its continued funding. This document also highlights the power which ownership of the Zcash trademark affords ECC, and argues that no decision-making process should proceed until that issue is resolved.

Zooko has [posted](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/note-about-trademark-strategy/34807) to address disagreement about how the Zcash trademark should be managed. The trademark is the sole property of ECC, but there has been a long-standing agreement to share control of it with a novel legal agreement which provided a double-veto. ECC has second thoughts about sharing control in a 2-of-2 multisig type arrangement because this is prone to deadlock and inaction. Ultimately the post argues ECC should wait until the decision about funding is made to decide how control of the trademark should be decentralized. 

Icon announced a [paper](https://m.icon.foundation/download/Contribution_Proposal_Paper_EN.pdf) about how their Contribution Proposal system will work. Proposals will be submitted on chain (with a security deposit of around $100 minimum), where a majority vote (of "ICONists", but I think this just means people staking ICX) will determine whether the proposal is approved to receive funding. Approved proposals are allowed to receive delegation, and in effect the proposal receives a share of available funding determined by the proportion of staked ICX delegated to it. Progress reports will be required for all approved proposals every 30 days, ICX stakeholders read these proposals and can rescind a proposal's approval with a majority vote. It is not clear what the target is for this system to be complete and in production.

Maker [deployed](https://blog.makerdao.com/an-update-to-maker-governance-polling/) a new [Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/), the UX has been improved to make voting easier and allow holders of MKR to vote on binding executive decisions (about stability fee) at the same time as voting on governance polls - something which was not previously possible. All of the content associated with governance polls is stored off chain on "any publicly accessible source". A hash of the poll is committed to the blockchain, and participants can check whether the content in the public source has been edited by checking this hash.

Maker [polled](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) voters to determine the priority for integrating 7 different assets that were pre-approved by the risk team into multi-collateral DAI. GNT (17% approval, 1.2% participation), ZRX (76% approval, 2.3% participation), OMG (38% approval, 1.2% participation), REP (92% approval, 3.6% participation), BAT(99.8% approval, 2.3% participation), ETH (100% approval, 4.3% participation), DGD (42% approval, 1.3% participation). The maximum number of unique voting wallets per proposal was 50 (for the ETH vote). These votes serve as a signal to the developers about which assets the voters would like to see added first.

Tezos [launched](https://medium.com/@tezosagora/enter-agora-c9e545ce4862) its [Agora](https://www.tezosagora.org/) governance tracker, which presents live information about the current state of the protocol amendment cycle, as well as historical information about past cycles. Discussion does not happen on the Agora site directly, instead each proposal links to a [Discourse forum](https://forum.tezosagora.org/) post. The functionality afforded by Agora is on a par with the [voting.decred.org](https://voting.decred.org/) page, it presents information about consensus rule change votes. Agora has more to do in this regard, as the Tezos voting process is more complex than Decred's, with the process for deploying new consensus rules having more stages.

The Babylon 2.0 proposal is currently in its testing phase, having beaten Babylon 1.0 (a previous version) in [round 1](https://www.tezosagora.org/period/16) (78% to 22%, voter turnout of 49%) and received virtually unanimous support in the [second round](https://www.tezosagora.org/period/17) (voter turnout of 82%, although only 179 of 463 bakers voted). This protocol change makes a number of improvements, adjusts the dynamic quorum rules to cap it, and mints 500 XTZ from inflation so that the developers can buy some drinks.

The Tezos Foundation made a [grant](https://tezos.foundation/news/camlcase-receives-grant-to-develop-decentralized-exchange-protocol-on-tezos) to CamlCase to develop a decentralized exchange protocol, inspired by Uniswap, on the Tezos blockchain. There are no details about the amount of the grant in the announcement.

Steemit [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/steemit-to-automate-development-funding-with-new-dao) a hard fork for Aug 27 to enable a [worker proposal system](https://steemit.com/blocktrades/@blocktrades/proposing-a-worker-proposal-system-for-steem) or DAO to administer funding from block rewards - with the intention of speeding up and decentralizing development. Steem users make stake-weighted votes to prioritize funding requests, the top proposals are funded until the available budget is spent.

[Sellout DAO](https://devpost.com/software/sellout-dao) was created to demonstrate that members of MolochDAO (or Moloch clones) can sell their right to submit proposals with a smart proxy contract that allows the highest bidder to submit a proposal. This [initial version](https://selloutdao.com/) seems to have been for demo purposes [only](https://twitter.com/nanexcool/status/1168640894947471360?s=20), but version 2 is apparently coming.

The /r/ethtrader moderator team and community seems to have undergone a [hard fork](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/cs84ar/6_of_10_moderators_are_leaving_ethtrader_a/), as 6 moderators resigned to start /r/ethfinance because the lead moderator had been making unilateral decisions and stripping moderator status from mods who disagreed with him. Part of the disagreement was about the Donuts experiment, with the lead moderator having many [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/cs84ar/6_of_10_moderators_are_leaving_ethtrader_a/exe5mo0) Donuts than anyone else and failing to update other moderators on progress with the reddit admins.

PIVX is dealing with an issue where some small stakers are receiving much greater rewards than they should be, in a long [post](https://pivx.org/a-response-to-the-article-pivx-and-200-pos-chains-currently-vulnerable-chains-already-under-attack/) about it a PIVX ambassador makes the case that the situation is not as severe as another [article](https://hackernoon.com/pivx-and-all-pivx-forks-vulnerable-in-a-pos-exploit-several-chains-already-under-attack-vx13xf3vqy) implied, and considers the difficult position PIVX developers are in with hundreds of forks relying on their codebase. 

A Coindesk [article](https://www.coindesk.com/despite-ceo-claims-dash-isnt-really-the-most-used-crypto-in-venezuela) explored the reality of Dash adoption in Venezuela, suggesting that it was not being used as widely as claimed by some Dash representatives, and that some of the programs to promote adoption among merchants were ineffective.

Australia is [considering](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-20/transacting-$10,000-or-more-in-cash-could-make-you-a-criminal/11429230) to ban cash payments to businesses larger than $10K, affecting major purchases like cars, housing, and such. This will not apply to individual-to-individual transactions. Commenters noted that this can be abused as a tool to implement negative interest rates, on top of standard surveillance concerns.

The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has [sanctioned](https://www.coindesk.com/us-treasury-blacklists-bitcoin-litecoin-addresses-of-chinese-drug-kingpins) three Chinese nationals under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. This involved freezing their US-based assets, publishing details of their email aliases and other identifying information, along with Bitcoin and Litecoin addresses.
