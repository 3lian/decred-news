## Governance

In August the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 15,278 DCR and spent 8,223 DCR. Using August's daily average DCR/USD rate of $26.23, this is $401K received and $216K spent. As these payments were for work completed in July, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the July average daily rate of $28.97 - in which case the USD spent figure is $238K. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {n} DCR ({n.nn} million USD at ${n.nn}).

## Media

{community efforts: Decred Assembly, websites, etc}

Since April there have been a transfer of knowledge about DJ production in order to make it more "decentralized". As a result, several documents were created:

* self-describing [template](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/journal-template.md)
* revamped [contributing](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md) page, 
* [content plan](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/content.md) with ideas for expansion
* huge guidelines doc that captures the vision and ways of DJ is [under construction](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/pull/91)

## Community Discussions

Comm systems news:

* Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/coppup/i_did_a_review_of_the_powpos_mechanism_used_in/) was removed where the author tried to get exposure for his project by posting a low effort review of how Decred's hybrid PoW+PoS does not work. Our moderation is transparent thanks to publicmodlogs {link}
* Yet another case where a [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cvrddy/raising_the_limit_of_coins/) received a proper answer and was quickly deleted. It was "undeleted", but the deletion of the original post caused the answer to lose visibility. This pattern discourages knowledgeable people from putting in the effort to answer questions on reddit. In this case the question poster actually [apologized](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cvwmsz/raising_the_limit_of_coins_undelete/ey7p6qr) for deleting their post in the "undeleted" repost.
* More impostors were detected in Telegram that promise to help with your technical problem for a modest 0.05 BTC. Beware the scammers.

## Markets

In August DCR was trading between USD {n.nn}-{n.nn} / BTC {}-{}. The average daily rate was ${n.nn}.

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

In context of discussing market maker proposals, [CoinMarketBook](https://coinmarketbook.cc/) argues "Market cap is a lie. Buy support tells the true story". As of 2019-08-19, DCR is #95 in that rating with only $260K of buy support at 10% distance from highest bid price. For context: BTC has $360M, ETH $55M, LTC $23M, XMR $9.5M, DASH $5.7M, DOGE $4.6M.

Australia is [considering](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-20/transacting-$10,000-or-more-in-cash-could-make-you-a-criminal/11429230) to ban cash payments to businesses larger than $10K, affecting major purchases like cars, housing, and such. This will not apply to individual-to-individual transactions. Commenters noted that this can be abused as a tool to implement negative interest rates, on top of standard surveillance concerns.
