# {DRAFT} Decred Journal – {MONTH} {YEAR} {DRAFT}

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

## Development

Final version 1.3.0 of core software was released! Changes are the same as reported in the [previous issue](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201808) for the RC1 version, plus some bugfixes that landed in RC2 and the 1.3.0 final. Read the full release notes and grab the downloads [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.0). As always, don't forget to verify signatures.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): completed several steps towards [multipeer downloads](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1145), [improved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1447) introduction to the software in the main [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/README.md), continued porting cleanups and refactoring from upstream [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd).

Currently in review are [initial release](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1434) of smart [fee estimator](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412) and a change to [UTXO set semantics](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1471). The latter is a large and important change that provides simpler handling, and resolves various issues with the previous approach. A lot of testing and careful review is needed so any help is welcome.

Educational series for new Decred developers by @matheusd added two episodes: [02 Simnet Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGbsU2PjpLM) shows how to automate simnet management with tmux and [03 Miner Reward Invalidation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECB8vDzOd1M) explains block validity rules.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): bugfixes and RPC improvements to support desktop and mobile wallets.

Developers are welcome to comment on [this idea](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/1217) to derive stakepool keys from the HD wallet seed. This would eliminate the need to backup and restore redeem scripts, thus greatly improving wallet UX. (missed in July issue)

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): bugfixes, refactoring to make the sync process more robust, new [loading animations](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1612), design polishing.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): multiple [improvements](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/472) to the CLI client (security conscious users with more funds at risk might prefer CLI), security hardening. A [feature](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/479) to deprecate or timeout proposals was identified as necessary for initial release and the work started. Privacy enhancement to not leak metadata of ticket holders ([issue](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/486), [PR](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/487)).

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): @collins: "Second test release for dcrandroid is out. Major bugs have been fixed since last test. Latest code from SPV sync has been integrated. Once again, bug reports are welcome and issues can be opened [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues)". Ask on Slack #dev about the APK for testing.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): @macsleven: "the test version of Decred Wallet for iOS is available, we have a link for installing the app but the builds currently require your UDID. Contact either @macsleven or @raedah with your UDID if you would like to help test."

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): v3.0 was released for mainnet! Highlights: [charts](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts), "merged debits" view, [agendas](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/agendas) page, Insight API support, side chain tracking, Go 1.11 support with module builds, numerous backend improvements. Full release notes [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/releases/tag/v3.0.0). [9 contributors](https://twitter.com/chappjc/status/1039172760143060994) made it happen. Project lead @chappjc [notes](https://twitter.com/chappjc/status/1039173243452772353): "This collaboration with @raedahgroup on our own block explorer and web API for @decredproject has been super productive."

Trezor: proof of concept implementation for Trezor Model T firmware is [in the works](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-core/pull/358) (previous work was for Model One).

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): update to use Go modules, simnet support and several fixes.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): beginner's guide [overhaul](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/587), multiple fixes and cleanups.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): add 3rd party wallets, remove web wallet, multiple fixes.

  {worthy?} After ignoring Decred for 2.5 years CoinDesk surprised us. This is the first article tagged ['governance'](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/governance/) that covers Decred's novel governance system, and first tagged ['Decred'](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/decred/).

* How the DEX could benefit Decred:

  > The trouble with infrastructure, "thin" protocols in particular, is that someone has to build them at a cost. e.g. LN takes a ton of work, doesn't necessarily generate value itself, but it magnifies the value of BTC or whatever coin that uses it. I see the DEX in a similar light - whoever creates it is not going to make a bunch of money from it, but it will magnify the value of the underlying asset(s) that end up having a deep order book on the DEX.

## Markets

On Sep 6 DCR revisited USD {} / BTC 0.0054 when BTC quickly dropped from USD 7300 to 6400

As of Sep 7, Decred is #13 by the number of daily active addresses with 10k addresses, and #9 by the USD cost of daily issuance with $180k.

Sep 14 price recovery coincided with KuCoin trading start and hashrate spike to 104 PH/s.

A vulnerability in BitcoinCore. btt, amateur, core voiced their concerns about using multiple impls. Worth noting that Decred's vision is quite the opposite: more full node implementations is strength, just like for any Internet protocol.
