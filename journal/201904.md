# {DRAFT} Decred Journal – April 2019

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

April saw the launch of Lightning Network on Decred's testnet! This is a great time to [check it out](https://hackernoon.com/decred-wants-you-be-one-of-the-first-to-test-the-dcr-lightning-network-dd9ecf14d95e), do some testing, and start building on DCR LN. 

LN will become available on mainnet when DCP0004 activates in block 342,785 (~ May 9), but it will take time to build up the network and work out the kinks. Use of DCR LN should for now be considered experimental and not involve large sums of DCR. Testnet is where the LN action will happen for some time. It is also important for all nodes to **upgrade before May 9th to avoid being forked off the network!**

Politeia software saw a significant round of performance improvements and new features (like diff viewing for proposal versions) deployed on the live proposals site. The contractor management system is ready to go in a basic form and will be used for collecting and processing contractor invoices in April.

This month's edition of Decred Journal has been a more decentralized production than usual, with @bee stepping back from the pivotal role they have played thus far (but keeping a steady supply of notes coming) and other contributors doing a bit more than they usually would.

## Upgrade your nodes!

The successfully [voted in](https://voting.decred.org/) rule change DCP0004 (updating sequence lock rules to enable LN) will activate in block 342,785 (~9 May). Once someone makes a transaction that relies on this rule change, any nodes that are still following the old rules (i.e. any software version before v1.4.0) will cease following the legitimate Decred chain. It is therefore important that all nodes (miners, voters, users, merchants, service providers) upgrade their Decred software to v1.4.0 before May 9. **Don't be forked off the network on May 9!**

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Refactoring continues, with cleanup of unused functions and conditions, improvements to mining code and a revamp of `chaincfg` module. Careful code upgrades without breaking things are possible due to previous work on versioned modules, which are now available and in full use.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): Code cleanup and improvements to ticket purchase code. Work started to add [optional authentication](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1437) for gRPC API, which allows to omit private passphrase in API calls that require an unlocked wallet. This will mitigate issues that arise when unlocked wallets are isolated via physical and networked segmentation, it does not require a private passphrase for every action requested by the client, but instead allows wallets to be unlocked via passphrase token.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): Responsive design was [implemented](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2094) in Create New Wallet view. The design phase is complete for most views as tracked in this [master issue](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1820), more implementation to come. A [PR](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2107) to add an embedded LN wallet UI to Decrediton was opened, this initial version will allow Decrediton users to perform actions like open/close channels, add/withdraw funds, create invoices and send payments.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): An upgrade was [deployed](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1120398754216062978) on the live proposals site which brings significant performance improvements, adds a diff viewer to the proposal version history viewer drop-down, and changes the default ordering of comments to show top scoring comments first. The Contractor Management System is ready for use and will be used by contractors to submit their invoices for April.

[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd): Decred’s Lightning Network (LN) is live on testnet! After months of hard work, and several changes across the whole software stack, Decred’s official port of the original [lnd daemon](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd), [dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd), has been [released](https://matheusd.com/post/announcing-dcrlnd/) and is ready for testnet usage. All unit and integration tests from the upstream Lightning Network project and are passing, and an initial integration with Decredition has been completed, allowing for basic LN wallet functionality (adding/withdrawing funds, opening/closing channels, sending payments) [Can’t find PRs related to this. Are there any we can link to?]. 
A lnd faucet has been [styled](https://github.com/matheusd/lightning-faucet/pull/4) for Decred look and feel. Check out one of several testnet faucets [here](https://testnet-dcrln-01.davec.name/) for a peek.  

Work is underway to prepare LN for mainnet, and Lightning will be technically activated on mainnet after the fixlnseqlock agenda [activates](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/agendas) in block 342784, around May 9. It will take time to build up the network and improve the user experience. Use of DCR LN should for now be considered experimental and not involve large sums of DCR. Testnet is where the LN action will happen for some time.

[dcrandroid](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): Minor bug fixes and language optimizations continue. Optional biometric authentication option has been [implemented](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/pull/343) and will be released in the next version, adding an extra layer of security on top of entering the wallet passphrase. 

[dcrios](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): Dcrios beta saw continued testing by community members and refinements to the UI. Only a few outstanding bugs remain, and team members continue working through the formal process of getting the app approved by the Apple Store.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata) v4.1.0 was released and deployed on [explorer.dcrdata.org](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/). This version adds [vote tracking](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/agendas) for live on-chain consensus rules change proposals, along with a number of performance improvements and minor fixes. Voting charts for [Politeia proposals](https://alpha.dcrdata.org/proposals) have been added and iterated on the [alpha.explorer.org](https://alpha.dcrdata.org/proposals) site. 

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs):  New pages: [Premine](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/premine/) is dedicated to describing Decred's airdrop and launch (a common source of misconception), [Verifying Votes](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/verifying-votes/) describes how to verify ticket votes using the Decred block explorer or the Command Line Interface (CLI), [Hardare Wallets](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/hardware-wallets/) provides basic info on hardware wallets that support DCR. The [Introduction to Decred Governance](https://docs.decred.org/governance/overview/) page has been overhauled to better explain ticket voting and Politeia’s role in decision-making.

Dev activity stats for April: {} active PRs, {} master commits, {} added and {} deleted lines spread across {} repositories. Contributions came from {}-{} developers per repository. ([chart]({}))

## Governance

The  [consensus vote](https://voting.decred.org/) to implement DCP0004 completed on Apr 11 with almost 100% approval and 54.5% of tickets actively participating by voting Yes. The new rules will activate on Apr 9, see note above about upgrading node software.

In April the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 15,460 DCR and spent 13,943 DCR. Using April's daily average DCR/USD rate of $24.22, this is $374K received and $338K spent. As these payments were for work completed in March, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the March average daily rate of $18.14 - in which case the USD received/spent figures are $280K/$253K. As of Apr 3, Treasury balance is 608,069 DCR (16 million USD at $26.20).

Proposal status as of Apr 4:

3 new proposals were submitted in April:

[Decentralize Treasury Spending](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) submitted by @moo31337, a proposal to hold monthly on-chain votes to approve Treasury spends. Voting has not started yet.

This proposal attracted a lot of discussion and was featured in the news. Some implementation details are omitted by design:

> the reason is that in the many years of software development we have learned to only plan two steps ahead and evaluate where we stand after achieving set goals. Planning too far ahead pretty much always ends with reality colliding with the plan. So, yes it is hand-wavy but by design. Once the technical realities become apparent we can let them dictate the process. ([@moo31337](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/6))

[Fiat Pairs integration on EXMO Exchange](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/950e8149e594b01c010c1199233ab11e82c9da39174ba375d286dc72bb0a54d7) submitted by @vadymprykhodko, requesting ~$23,800 for work on integrating DCR on EXMO exchange with BTC and 2 fiat pairs (DCR/RUB, DCR/UAH). This proposal was approved with 62.5% Yes votes.

[Amendment to Decred Constitution](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fd56bb79e0383f40fc2d92f4473634c59f1aa0abda7aabe29079216202c83114) submitted by @richard-red, proposes a set of edits to the Decred constitution to bring it up to date, and clarifies the constitution's status within the project. Voting is open and more than 10k votes have already been cast, with 98.6% being Yes votes. Thanks to @richardred for leading the effort and to everyone who shared feedback along the way.

Voting concluded for a further 3 proposals in April.

The proposal to fund [Trust Wallet](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ababdea7da2b3d8312a773d477272135a883ed772ba99cdf31eddb5f261d571) integration (estimated cost of $3,300 plus $100/month ongoing) was approved with 67% Yes votes. The proposal to open an RFP type process for [ATM integration](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/aea224a561cfed183f514a9ac700d68ba8a6c71dfbee71208fb9bff5fffab51d) was narrowly rejected with 52.5% Yes votes - the first proposal to be rejected with > 50% Yes votes. In a [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$15542882616188dHEHP:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) in the #proposals channel there seemed to be consensus that it would be fair to try again with a different version of this proposal, as it was only narrowly rejected. The proposal to bring Decred to Africa (Ghana) by @georgepro was rejected with just 5.4% Yes votes. Following the conclusion of voting (when comments are no longer open on Politeia) @jet_user made a long and thoughtful [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/b9vhee/voting_has_started_for_the_bring_decred_to_africa/eks6578/) on the reddit post related to this proposal.

## Outreach

April was a very busy month coordinating outreach, planning meetups and events, and getting setup on various platforms to begin executing the marketing plan. Anshawblack took admin reign of Decred DCR in Telegram, and has been facilitating excellent discussions by sharing quality Decred content. Here’s a brief update on progress of the Marketing Plan approved in Politeia.

Decred Assembly: Dustorf & jy-p did a practice session, then came back two weeks later to tape the first episode of the DA revamp. It was decided rather than record a single show, record segments separately in order to share a greater number of more digestible videos. For April, we filed a Deep Dive with jy-p on the DEX, a Decred Distributed edition with Elian talking about Mexico and LA, and Decred Debunks segment with richardred shooting down Boaty McBoatface and the idea that stakeholders won’t make good decisions. The project needs to reset the YouTube password in order to post these videos on a weekly basis, which we hope to accomplish by the time this is published. The May edition has already been scheduled.

Decred Newsletter: We have decided to use an open-source service, https://www.phplist.org/, which has caused some delay. The construct has been set and tests have been sent successfully. Currently, the design team is building out a template to make it look pretty, and they are working to incorporate a signup link into decred.org. Once that is done, we will share that to get people signed up and we expect to send the first email in May.

Website Updates: The architecture is set and a first draft of the copy is written for most of the additional subpages. Additionally, a second version of copy has been written for the new introductory video, which will be broken into three parts: Secure. Adaptable. Self-Funding. 

Decred in Depth Podcast: anshawblack is traveling to NYC for Blockchain Week beginning on May 11th and plans to record episodes with jy-p, muststopmurad, Joel Monegro, JZ, permabull nino, and Trey Ditto. He will then edit and trickle out the episodes over the coming weeks and months.  

Community Organizers: The volume of Decred meetups and the number of events attended below highlights the success we’ve had mobilizing communities across the world. A meetup guide and tools to execute meetups will be part of the website updates. Until then, assets can be found [on the Github Design Repo](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases). A reminder that if you would like a meetup in your neighborhood, start one! Decred community members take the lead on everything, there is no one dictating what happens where, simply community enablement. 

Decred was [V Label Verifiied](https://medium.com/binanceexchange/binance-infos-v-label-verification-f3506f64b292) on Binance. To become verified, an official member of the project (someone with a Decred email and KYC'd identity on Binance - @s_ben) reviewed and verified the information on Decred's [profile page](https://info.binance.com/en/currencies/decred). This allowed us an opportunity to update the project description to be more accurate and incorporate new marketing messaging, as well as correct some erroneous information about Decred's launch (a common task).

## Events

Comm systems news:

* Servers hosting matrix.org and riot.im were compromised and taken down on Apr 11 for emergency security maintenance, disrupting our communications for several hours. If your homeserver is matrix.org, change your password. Incident report [here](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/11/security-incident/), tweet timeline [here](https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1116304867683905537), and [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues/371) are recommendations from the hacker to the admins. Decred's homeserver (matrix.decred.org) was not affected. A good moment to say thanks to our admins who work every day to keep a lot of self-hosted infrastructure running. The incident disrupted our comms for many hours because many people are using the browser Riot.im client which was taken offline. To be resilient against such issues, users should consider installing standalone client (desktop or mobile). Another idea is to [self-host Riot](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/62).

## Markets

Bitcoin broke the 5000 USD barrier on April 3rd and most other crypto currencies reacted as expected there was an increase in Coin/USD rate but decrease in Coin/BTC rate. Bitcoin tested 5500 multiple times over the month, but ultimately was hovering between $5000 - $5500.  

In April DCR was trading between USD 19.97-26.68 / BTC 0.0045-0.0052 as per [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decred/#charts). The average daily rate was $ 24.22.

@richard-red has collected and [shared](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/crypto-governance-research/tree/master/governance-proposals) comprehensive proposal voting data-sets for Decred, Dash and Aragon, and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/RichardRed0x/status/1114552602237313024) some basic statistics like average voter participation for each project. At the time of writing (Apr 6), based on proposals that had finished voting, Decred had an average ticket participation of 76% for on chain votes and 31% for Politeia proposals; Dash had an average masternode participation of 19% in its Treasury proposals; Aragon had an average ANT token participation of 4.5% in voting on Aragon Governance Proposals.

The second round of Aragon AGP voting concluded its 2 day voting window on Apr 27. 9 proposals were voted on, with a mean participation rate of 3.8% of circulating ANT tokens. 6 proposals were accepted, 3 rejected. 

3 of the proposals concerned Polkadot in some way, after the leaders of Aragon One had stated that they are considering developing a second Aragon application on Polkadot. A proposal to buy some DOTs with the Aragon Association's ETH (with a view to maintaining a parachain and participating in Polkadot governance) was firmly rejected by ANT voters, with just 7% Yes votes. A proposal to affirm Aragon's commitment to Ethereum and stop Aragon One working on Polkadot related development was more narrowly defeated (with 31% Yes votes). This proposal would have caused significant friction between Aragon One and the ANT holder community had it passed, with Luis Cuende stating in an [interview](https://www.coindesk.com/aragon-vote-aims-to-restrict-ethereum-app-from-funding-polkadot-blockchain) that he would have submitted a counter-proposal in the following round of AGP voting. In the third Polkadot-related proposal, 72% of voting ANT approved the Aragon Association to participate in a "lockdrop" for tokens on the forthcoming Edgeware parachain - leaving considerable discretion for the AA to decide how many tokens to lock and how long to lock them for. Another interesting proposal saw the Aragon Association asking for authority to arrange security audits directly (rather than going through the AGP process to vote on these decisions), this was approved with 93% Yes votes, while a proposal for continued funding from the group that currently performs security audits was rejected with 35% Yes votes.

The Dash sporking upgrade process [completed](https://blog.dash.org/product-update-april-5-2019-71344591a5e1) to enable Deterministic Masternode List (which is a requirement for chain locks that will deter PoW majority attacks) and Auto InstantSend. The activation of this spork caused Treasury proposal votes to be reset, and for most of the month it looked as though only a few proposals would reach the required level of votes to be funded. When superblock voting closed on Apr 29 voter participation rates were back to within their normal range and 15 proposals met the requirement. 660 DASH remained to be spent in the superblock, and is now lost to the Dash Treasury, but this level of underspend is not particularly uncommon. Among the [proposals](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/crypto-governance-research/commit/576d41c324429be375120f565bc6b807d3e1da30) were two from rival PR firms, Wachsman and Shift (until this point Dash Core Group had arranged such services directly at their discretion, and had been retaining the services of Wachsman). The Shift proposal, costing $10k per month as a retainer, passed with 536 Yes votes (90% Yes, but only 52 votes over the quorum requirement), while the Wachsman proposal was rejected with a score of -206.

The EOS constitution has been replaced with a new [user agreement](https://github.com/eosnewyork/eosuseragreement/blob/master/README.md), proposed on chain by [EOS New York](https://medium.com/eos-new-york/the-eos-user-agreement-has-been-proposed-on-chain-61bf3760b604) and [approved](https://eosauthority.com/approval/view?scope=eosnewyorkio&name=eosuseragree&lnc=en) by the 21 Block Producers. This change had been put to EOS holders in a [referendum](https://eosauthority.com/polls_details?proposal=eosuseragree_20190207&lnc=en). The referendum has a long duration (3 months) and is not due to finish until May 8, there is strong support for the proposal (98% Yes) but voter participation is very low (1.7%). EOS referendums had a notional quorum requirement of 15%, but in light of the fact that none of the polls are even close to reaching that level of participation, it seems like the BPs have decided to bypass the formal referendum process and move forward with some of the proposed changes. The EOS BPs also [approved](https://twitter.com/zeroxeos/status/1118833569118466048) the deployment of REX (Resource Exchange), but it [failed](https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/bekd4f/rex_is_here_status_approved_by_15_bp/) execution on chain and will have to be re-proposed.

Aeternity is [planning](https://blog.aeternity.com/aeternity-first-on-chain-governance-vote-decentralization-2-0-5e0c8a01891a) to hold its first on-chain governance vote May 7-14. The proposal to be voted on is establishing a "Block Reward Initiative (BRI), through which ~0–20% of miner rewards will be allocated to development". The announcement post references Aeternity's ICO funds as being sufficient to fund development for years to come, and positions the BRI as a transition to a self-sustaining platform. BRI funds would be given to a charitable foundation registered in Liechtenstein, and administered by a technical council. AE token holders will vote for 0, 5, 10, 15 or 20% of the block rewards to go to this foundation - as long as more than 50% of AE votes for a share greater than 0%, the percentage will be set using a weighted average of the votes for options greater than 0%. This will leave some AE holders who don't want the block reward funding with a difficult choice of whether to vote for 0% and hope to be in the majority (and otherwise be ignored) or to vote for 5% to lower the weighted average in the case that the proposal is approved.

Ycash, a "friendly fork" of Zcash, was [announced](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/announcing-ycash-the-first-friendly-fork-of-the-zcash-blockchain/33162). Ycash will build off a snapshot of the Zcoin chain, and will diverge in two ways (replacing the current 20% Founders Reward with a perpetual 5% reward going to a newly created Ycash foundation, and switching the PoW mining algorithm to something more conducive to mining on commodity hardware) while aiming to incorporate future improvements from Zcash. Zooko Wilcox wrote a [blog post](https://z.cash/blog/future-friendly-fork/) about "A Future Friendly Fork" in 2017, and this appears to have inspired the positioning of Ycash as a friendly fork. Zooko has also commented on the Ycash post to say that he sees Ycash as a positive development for Zcash.

The Zcash Foundation [announced](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/kzen-multisig/) funding for a research project with KZen Networks to focus on enabling n-of-n multisig transactions for Sapling Zcash without requiring a consensus change.

"Maker DAO" was the subject of some controversy this month, initially with an ongoing [issue](https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-set-to-increase-dai-fees-above-15-in-bid-to-stabilize-stablecoin) with the DAI peg to USD (with frequent stability increases lately failing to restore the peg) and then with some leaked information about [conflict](https://www.coindesk.com/darkest-days-yet-purple-pill-tell-all-details-years-long-rift-at-heart-of-makerdao-stablecoin-project) within the Maker team. [Zandy's story](https://www.scribd.com/document/407743542/Zandy-s-Story#from_embed) provides an interesting look into the history of Maker and the origins of the Maker Foundation as a last-minute move to avoid a hefty tax bill, and a subsequent falling out of the parties involved, with secret communications channels, a "purple pill" roadmap to try and resolve the conflict, board members being fired and having to relinquish their private multisig keys, and a [leaked letter](https://www.coindesk.com/leaked-letter-exposes-infighting-atop-flagship-ethereum-project-makerdao) that exposed the whole thing.

Zcoin [announced](https://zcoin.io/further-disclosure-on-zerocoin-vulnerability/) a vulnerability with the Zerocoin protocol that allowed forged coins to be created ("not exceeding 1% of the circulating supply"). Details are to be released later, once other projects exposed to a flaw with the cryptography of Zerocoin (PIVX, Veil and Gravity Coin) have had a chance to mitigate the issue. The Zcoin team called for Zerocoin spends to be disabled on Apr 9 when they detected the issue, and in this post on Apr 26 confirmed that it will remain disabled for Zcoin as they are working on a replacement (Sigma) which is nearly ready.

In [part 4](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-roadmap-2019-part-4-proposal-for-stake-based-liquidity-incentive-52c16558df29) of the 0x Roadmap [ZEIP-31](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/31) was proposed, which would add incentives for market makers to hold the ZRX token. This is in response to a lack of correlation between users of 0x and ZRX token holders. ZRX is designed to be used to govern the protocol, which is unlikely to work well in a scenario where the main users do not hold any ZRX. The proposal is at the start of a long process to develop and audit the new smart contracts then hold a tokenholder vote to approve/reject the integration of the changes. 

Bitcoin (Cash) Satoshi's Vision (BSV) has been [delisted](https://www.coindesk.com/kraken-exchange-joins-binance-shapeshift-in-delisting-bitcoin-sv) by a number of exchanges as part of an ongoing feud between Craig S Wright and some members of the Bitcoin community. Ironic that the poor behavior of a very visible front man is causing so much trouble for BSV.

Bitfinex encountered some [trouble](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitfinex-faces-legal-action-from-ny-attorney-general-heres-what-this-means/) from the New York Attorney General's office, in the form of a request for a court order to investigate transactions between certain legal entities relating to Bitfinex and Tether. Specifically, the NY AG alleges that Bitfinex lost some $850 million held by Crypto Capital (they claim it has been frozen), and borrowed from Tether reserves in order to keep Bitfinex operational. Tether [updated](https://news.bitcoin.com/while-tether-withdraws-claim-of-usd-backing-rival-stablecoins-provide-monthly-attestations/) their terms on [Feb 26](https://archive.today/yw7nb), adding that it may now back USDT by assets other than USD and delay the redemption or withdrawal because of poor liquidity or unavailability of the assets.

QuadrigaCX declared [bankrupt](https://cointelegraph.com/news/canadian-crypto-exchange-quadrigacx-officially-declared-bankrupt) after months of uncertainty.

A critical flaw was [discovered](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zmakk3/researchers-find-critical-backdoor-in-swiss-online-voting-system) in Switzerland's Internet Voting System (missed from March), which is scheduled to be used in elections this year. The flaw would allow someone to alter votes undetected. Cory Doctorow [wrote](https://boingboing.net/2019/03/13/principal-agent-problems.html) about this as exposing issues with internet voting around the auditing process and NDAs which cover code and silence criticizm from security researchers.

The G20 members will [meet](https://cointelegraph.com/news/g20-to-establish-crypto-aml-and-counter-terrorism-financing-regulations-in-june-report) in Japan in June and plan to agree on a framework to combat crypto-enabled money laundering and terrorism financing - with the main aim being anti-anonymity and the identification of individuals transacting in crypto-assets at the moment of transaction.

Researchers have [shown](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/intel-visa-sa-00086-exploit-researchers-computer-data-access-2014854) that a testing utility bundled with intel chips (Intel VISA) can allow an attacker to capture data from the CPU.

Former Mozilla exec [accuses](https://www.zdnet.com/article/former-mozilla-exec-google-has-sabotaged-firefox-for-years/) Google of sabotaging Firefox for years - through a long series of "mistakes" which led Google products to have issues on Firefox browser.

When it comes to privacy, New York Times has a good [sense of humor](https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1116354502032932865) - stuffing the "Privacy Project" homepage to the gills with third-party tracking scripts.
