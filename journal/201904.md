## Governance

{high level recap of decision-making activity, most important events, defer to Politeia Digest for the rest}

In April the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received {} DCR and spent {} DCR. Using April's daily average DCR/USD rate of ${}, this is ${}K received and ${}K spent. As these payments were for work completed in {prev month}, it is also informative to consider them in the context of the {prev month} average daily rate of ${} - in which case the USD received/spent figures are ${}K/${}K. As of {date}, Treasury balance is {} DCR ({} million USD at ${}).

Proposal status as of {}:

* Ghana proposal rejected by {}% No votes among {}K voted tickets. @bee posted late follow-up analysis https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/b9vhee/voting_has_started_for_the_bring_decred_to_africa/eks6578/
* EXMO integration vote started
* Constitution update vote started. Thanks to @richardred for leading the effort and to everyone who shared feedback.
* Trust Wallet integration update https://gist.github.com/oregonisaac/99925bca0cbc3b4b25f672639f72e08c

Awareness increased by visualization https://twitter.com/RichardRed0x/status/1119364265541099520

Decentralize Treasury Spending proposal attracted a lot of discussion and got featured in the news. A lot of implementation details are omitted by design:

> the reason is that in the many years of software development we have learned to only plan two steps ahead and evaluate where we stand after achieving set goals. Planning too far ahead pretty much always ends with reality colliding with the plan. So, yes it is hand-wavy but by design. Once the technical realities become apparent we can let them dictate the process.

## Outreach

April was a very busy month coordinating outreach, planning meetups and events, and getting setup on various platforms to begin executing the marketing plan. Anshawblack took admin reign of Decred Aggregator in Telegram, and has been facilitating excellent discussions by sharing quality Decred content. Here’s a brief update on progress of the Marketing Plan approved in Politeia.

Decred Assembly: Dustorf & jy-p did a practice session, then came back two weeks later to tape the first episode of the DA revamp. It was decided rather than record a single show, record segments separately in order to share a greater number of more digestible videos. For April, we filed a Deep Dive with jy-p on the DEX, a Decred Distributed edition with Elian talking about Mexico and LA, and Decred Debunks segment with richardred shooting down Boaty McBoatface and the idea that stakeholders won’t make good decisions. The project needs to reset the YouTube password in order to post these videos on a weekly basis, which we hope to accomplish by the time this is published. The May edition has already been scheduled.

Decred Newsletter: We have decided to use an open-source service, https://www.phplist.org/, which has caused some delay. The construct has been set and tests have been sent successfully. Currently, the design team is building out a template to make it look pretty, and they are working to incorporate a signup link into decred.org. Once that is done, we will share that to get people signed up and we expect to send the first email in May.

Website Updates: The architecture is set and a first draft of the copy is written for most of the additional subpages. Additionally, a second version of copy has been written for the new introductory video, which will be broken into three parts: Secure. Adaptable. Self-Funding. 

Decred in Depth Podcast: anshawblack is traveling to NYC for Blockchain Week beginning on May 11th and plans to record episodes with jy-p, muststopmurad, Joel Monegro, JZ, permabull nino, and Trey Ditto. He will then edit and trickle out the episodes over the coming weeks and months.  

Community Organizers: The volume of Decred meetups and the number of events attended below highlights the success we’ve had mobilizing communities across the world. A meetup guide and tools to execute meetups will be part of the website updates. Until then, assets can be found https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases. A reminder that if you would like a meetup in your neighborhood, start one! Decred community members take the lead on everything, there is no one dictating what happens where, simply community enablement.

Comm systems news:

* Servers hosting matrix.org and riot.im compromised and taken down on Apr 11 for emergency security maintenance, disrupting our communications for several hours. If your homeserver is matrix.org, change your password. Incident report [here](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/11/security-incident/), tweet timeline [here](https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1116304867683905537), and [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues/371) are recommendations from the hacker to the admins. Decred's homeserver (matrix.decred.org) was not affected. {clarify with admins}. A good moment to say thanks to our admins who work every day to keep a lot of self-hosted infrastructure running. The incident disrupted our comms for many hours because many people are using the browser Riot.im client which was taken offline. To be resilient against such issues, users should consider installing standalone client (desktop or mobile). Another idea is to [self-host Riot](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/62).
* There were multiple interruptions in the bridge with lots of messages were not delivered across the bridge.
* Matrix is moving to stop supporting self-signed certificates and rely on Certificate Authorities to behave.

@richard-red has collected and [shared](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/crypto-governance-research/tree/master/governance-proposals) comprehensive proposal voting data-sets for Decred, Dash and Aragon, and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/RichardRed0x/status/1114552602237313024) some basic statistics like average voter participation for each project. At the time of writing (Apr 6), based on proposals that had finished voting, Decred had an average ticket participation of 76% for on chain votes and 31% for Politeia proposals; Dash had an average masternode participation of 19% in its Treasury proposals; Aragon had an average ANT token participation of 4.5% in voting on Aragon Governance Proposals.

The second round of Aragon AGP voting concluded its 2 day voting window on Apr 27. 9 proposals were voted on, with a mean participation rate of 3.8% of circulating ANT tokens. 6 proposals were accepted, 3 rejected. 

3 of the proposals concerned Polkadot in some way, after the leaders of Aragon One had stated that they are considering developing a second Aragon application on Polkadot. A proposal to buy some DOTs with the Aragon Association's ETH (with a view to maintaining a parachain and participating in Polkadot governance) was firmly rejected by ANT voters, with just 7% Yes votes. A proposal to affirm Aragon's commitment to Ethereum and stop Aragon One working on Polkadot related development was more narrowly defeated (with 31% Yes votes). This proposal would have caused significant friction between Aragon One and the ANT holder community had it passed, with Luis Cuende stating in an [interview](https://www.coindesk.com/aragon-vote-aims-to-restrict-ethereum-app-from-funding-polkadot-blockchain) that he would have submitted a counter-proposal in the following round of AGP voting. In the third Polkadot-related proposal, 72% of voting ANT approved the Aragon Association to participate in a "lockdrop" for tokens on the forthcoming Edgeware parachain - leaving considerable discretion for the AA to decide how many tokens to lock and how long to lock them for. Another interesting proposal saw the Aragon Association asking for authority to arrange security audits directly (rather than going through the AGP process to vote on these decisions), this was approved with 93% Yes votes, while a proposal for continued funding from the group that currently performs security audits was rejected with 35% Yes votes.

The Dash sporking upgrade process [completed](https://blog.dash.org/product-update-april-5-2019-71344591a5e1) to enable Deterministic Masternode List (which is a requirement for chain locks that will deter PoW majority attacks) and Auto InstantSend. The activation of this spork caused Treasury proposal votes to be reset, and for most of the month it looked as though only a few proposals would reach the required level of votes to be funded. When superblock voting closed on Apr 29 voter participation rates were back to within their normal range and 15 proposals met the requirement. 660 DASH remained to be spent in the superblock, and is now lost to the Dash Treasury, but this level of underspend is not particularly uncommon. Among the [proposals](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/crypto-governance-research/commit/576d41c324429be375120f565bc6b807d3e1da30) were two from rival PR firms, Wachsman and Shift (until this point Dash Core Group had arranged such services directly at their discretion, and had been retaining the services of Wachsman). The Shift proposal, costing $10k per month as a retainer, passed with 536 Yes votes (90% Yes, but only 52 votes over the quorum requirement), while the Wachsman proposal was rejected with a score of -206.

The EOS constitution has been replaced with a new [user agreement](https://github.com/eosnewyork/eosuseragreement/blob/master/README.md), proposed on chain by [EOS New York](https://medium.com/eos-new-york/the-eos-user-agreement-has-been-proposed-on-chain-61bf3760b604) and [approved](https://eosauthority.com/approval/view?scope=eosnewyorkio&name=eosuseragree&lnc=en) by the 21 Block Producers. This change had been put to EOS holders in a [referendum](https://eosauthority.com/polls_details?proposal=eosuseragree_20190207&lnc=en). The referendum has a long duration (3 months) and is not due to finish until May 8, there is strong support for the proposal (98% Yes) but voter participation is very low (1.7%). EOS referendums had a notional quorum requirement of 15%, but in light of the fact that none of the polls are even close to reaching that level of participation, it seems like the BPs have decided to bypass the formal referendum process and move forward with some of the proposed changes. The EOS BPs also [approved](https://twitter.com/zeroxeos/status/1118833569118466048) the deployment of REX (Resource Exchange), but it [failed](https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/bekd4f/rex_is_here_status_approved_by_15_bp/) execution on chain and will have to be re-proposed.

Ycash, a "friendly fork" of Zcash, was [announced](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/announcing-ycash-the-first-friendly-fork-of-the-zcash-blockchain/33162). Ycash will build off a snapshot of the Zcoin chain, and will diverge in two ways (replacing the current 20% Founders Reward with a perpetual 5% reward going to a newly created Ycash foundation, and switching the PoW mining algorithm to something more conducive to mining on commodity hardware) while aiming to incorporate future improvements from Zcash. Zooko Wilcox wrote a [blog post](https://z.cash/blog/future-friendly-fork/) about "A Future Friendly Fork" in 2017, and this appears to have inspired the positioning of Ycash as a friendly fork. Zooko has also commented on the Ycash post to say that he sees Ycash as a positive development for Zcash.

The Zcash Foundation [announced](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/kzen-multisig/) funding for a research project with KZen Networks to focus on enabling n-of-n multisig transactions for Sapling Zcash without requiring a consensus change.

"Maker DAO" was the subject of some controversy this month, initially with an ongoing [issue](https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-set-to-increase-dai-fees-above-15-in-bid-to-stabilize-stablecoin) with the DAI peg to USD (with frequent stability increases lately failing to restore the peg) and then with some leaked information about [conflict](https://www.coindesk.com/darkest-days-yet-purple-pill-tell-all-details-years-long-rift-at-heart-of-makerdao-stablecoin-project) within the Maker team. [Zandy's story](https://www.scribd.com/document/407743542/Zandy-s-Story#from_embed) provides an interesting look into the history of Maker and the origins of the Maker Foundation as a last-minute move to avoid a hefty tax bill, and a subsequent falling out of the parties involved, with secret communications channels, a "purple pill" roadmap to try and resolve the conflict, board members being fired and having to relinquish their private multisig keys, and a [leaked letter](https://www.coindesk.com/leaked-letter-exposes-infighting-atop-flagship-ethereum-project-makerdao) that exposed the whole thing.

Zcoin [announced](https://zcoin.io/further-disclosure-on-zerocoin-vulnerability/) a vulnerability with the Zerocoin protocol that allowed forged coins to be created ("not exceeding 1% of the circulating supply"). Details are to be released later, once other projects exposed to a flaw with the cryptography of Zerocoin (PIVX, Veil and Gravity Coin) have had a chance to mitigate the issue. The Zcoin team called for Zerocoin spends to be disabled on Apr 9 when they detected the issue, and in this post on Apr 26 confirmed that it will remain disabled for Zcoin as they are working on a replacement (Sigma) which is nearly ready.
