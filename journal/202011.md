{ introduction, major news of the month ordered by impact, don't put any links here }

- new v1.6 RCs (tons of bugfixing and polishing decrediton work)

## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Merged in master and backported to v1.6 release branch:

- limited mempool to not track stats for too many unconfirmed [ancestor](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2458) transactions. This allows to prevent a number of complexity attacks and speed up block template generation for large chains of unconfirmed transactions.
- default curve to generate RPC certificates changed to P-256 because Chromium (used by Decrediton via Electron) removed support for a stronger P-521, which was previously the default for dcrd. { why not set it up on decrediton end? }
- corrected treasury vote [status handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2469) in RPC commands
- added new field to output of some RPC commands to indicate [treasurybase](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2470) inputs (i.e. funds coming from the new treasury)
- fixed [orphan blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2474) stalling sync process { not sure I translated this correctly }

Other merged:

- gencerts tool gained the ability to generate certificates signed by a local CA certificate and key, which helps to reduce configuration complexity
- fixed concurrency issues
- more tests for [rpcserver](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2069)
- refactored [upgrade](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2457) logic to deduplicate and make it faster to write future upgrades

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- use [random coin](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1914) selection for all regular sends
- save unpublished [fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1915) tarnsaction to prevent double spends across wallet restarts
- send ticket's [parent tx](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1917) in feeaddress request { why? }
- use correct [change account](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1919) for paying VSP fees when performing a mixed ticket purchase, in order to prevent unmixed change from being used with a mixed account { is it fair to say that there was no privacy leaks because VSP mixed staking is not released yet and there was no such issue for solo mixed staking? }
- make max VSP fee [configurable](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1933)
- bug fixes and documentation updates

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- updating of Trezor [firmware](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2932) (a step towards [Trezor staking](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2681) support)
- [Privacy](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2987) page reworked for simplicity, following the updated [design](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2965)
- introduction to [Privacy](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2885) help page
- added [logs](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2888) to Privacy page
- ability to allow sending transactions from accounts [other than](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2909) mixed account
- [filter](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2854) proposals that finished voting by their approved or rejected status
- filter for [mixed](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2926) transactions
- don't allow to [close](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3005) Decrediton while certain operations are running
- [AppImage](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2864) packaging where Decrediton comes as a single executable file (as a side effect this allows GNOME users to avoid having to launch it via CLI)
- removed [max wallets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2886) limit
- fixed wrong [change](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2889) destination for privacy wallets
- updated [Chinese](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2927) translation
- added partial new [translations](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2974) to Arabic, Italian and Polish
- many UI tweaks

Around 60 bugs were fixed in October and ~65 in November. The growing list of Decrediton's features requires more testing firepower. Big thanks to all testers who help to improve Decrediton!

In progress:

- migration to [grpc-js](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2936) to significantly reduce build time and binary size
- automated tests for [Get Started](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2659) and [Settings](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2957) pages
- [Trezor](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2869) ticket purchasing on testnet

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

- inline [images](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2201) in drafts
- numerous [design fixes](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2197)
- automated [UI testing](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2151) using [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- bug fixes

CMS:

- infrastructure for tracking GitHub [activity stats](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1185) which will be used to ensure that developers' progress matches their billed hours
- stats for past invoices and GitHub contributions on the Invoice page to help admins with the review
- multiple fixes

{ that moment when we want another tlog update :) }

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

- do not reject tickets with [invalid](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/199) vote choices { why? }
- accept optional [parent transaction](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/205) hex in fee address request
- bug fixes and code cleanup

**[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool)**

- completed [Postgres](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/282) implementation. All database tests are now run against both Bolt and Postgres. { a few highlights what Postgres offers to dcrpool would help }
- extracted [errors](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/284) package to decouple support extracting database into its own package
- bug fixes and code cleanup

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

- added an [IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) [facility](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/117) to allow parent processes (such as Decrediton) to control dcrlnd process

October's [porting](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/103) of changes from the upstream lnd 0.11.x included fixes of [two](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002858.html) [vulnerabilities](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002857.html) that may potentially lead to loss of funds. More background from the person who discovered them [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002859.html) and [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002855.html).

It is recommended to upgrade to latest master or release candidate [tag](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/tags) of dcrlnd.

This proposal includes $1,000/month sponsorship of Gio, for which GoDCR has become a pioneering project. Approved with 92% support and 38% turnout.
* A related mobile wallets [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bc499c9) from @raedah requested $44K for a further 8 months of work on the Android and iOS mobile wallets. The mobile wallets share the dcrlibwallet component of GoDCR. Approved with 93% support and 38% turnout.
* A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3943bff) from @joegruff to further develop a Decred Address Scanner android app requested $3,000 for work already completed (app has been open source and in the Google store for a year) and $6,000 maximum for necessary updates and new features. Approved with 67% support and 34% turnout.
* A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/8a09324) from @paris_smithson to fund artwork production and marketing for [WhyDecred.com](https://www.whydecred.com/) originally requested $16,800 to fund 16 artworks, was edited to drop the request by $10K, before ultimately being abandoned with the idea that the site will be completed before another proposal is submitted.

The replacement for P2SH in BSV's electrum wallet was [found](https://www.reddit.com/r/bsv/comments/jq9jv3/and_its_gone_popular_bsv_multisig_provides_no/) to be fundamentally broken, allowing anyone to spend coins held in multi-sig hashes on the BSV chain.

The Value DeFi protocol was [hacked](https://rekt.ghost.io/value-defi-rekt/) for $7M, although the attacker returned $2M to the contract address for unknown reasons. The exploit was executed with a flash loan, coming less than 24 hours after Value DeFi had tweeted to boast about robust security with "flash loan attack prevention". 

The OUSD stablecoin was [hacked](https://medium.com/originprotocol/urgent-ousd-has-hacked-and-there-has-been-a-loss-of-funds-7b8c4a7d534c) with a flash loan used to conduct a reentrancy attack, to print and rebase (debase) OUSD equivalent to almost the entire circulating supply, allowing the hacker to extract $7M in value.

BCH fork

- how did the fork go?
- BCH moved to exchanges ahead of the hard fork https://twitter.com/philip_gradwell/status/1326452365004861440

Ethereum network experienced a [disruption](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-hard-fork-disruption) on Nov 11. Recent version of Geth node software silently fixed a consensus bug that was dormant for over a year. Since it changed consensus code, it had a risk of an unintended hard fork. One vendor discovered the bug independently and seeing that the majority of nodes have upgraded, decided to test it [in production](https://twitter.com/jinglanW/status/1326651349912719360) and see what would happen. To everyone's surprise, among the minority of nodes running old software was Infura, a popular service provider used by "dapps" to sync with Ethereum network. The bug-triggering transaction halted Infura and a bunch of "decentralized" finance apps that relied on it, including Metamask, MakerDAO, Uniswap, Compound, and others. Binance and other exchanges have also halted trading after noticing conflicting transaction histories. Infura resolved the issue within hours and posted a [post-mortem](https://blog.infura.io/infura-mainnet-outage-post-mortem-2020-11-11/) explaining why they didn't upgrade and calling out the danger of silent consensus fixes. Ethereum developer also published a [post-mortem](https://gist.github.com/karalabe/e1891c8a99fdc16c4e60d9713c35401f) for Geth, which explained that the fix was done silently to not attract unwanted attention from attackers. Among other things, the incident teaches us that deploying critical fixes is challenging because it is a trade-off between informing good actors while not informing bad ones.
