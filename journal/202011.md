## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Merged in master and backported to v1.6 release branch:

- limited mempool to not track stats for too many unconfirmed [ancestor](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2458) transactions. This allows to prevent a number of complexity attacks and speed up block template generation for large chains of unconfirmed transactions.
- default curve to generate RPC certificates changed to P-256 because Chromium (used by Decrediton via Electron) removed support for a stronger P-521, which was previously the default for dcrd. { why not set it up on decrediton end? }
- corrected treasury vote [status handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2469) in RPC commands
- added new field to output of some RPC commands to indicate [treasurybase](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2470) inputs (i.e. funds coming from the new treasury)
- fixed [orphan blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2474) stalling sync process { not sure I translated this correctly }

Other merged:

- gencerts tool gained the ability to generate certificates signed by a local CA certificate and key, which helps to reduce configuration complexity
- fixed concurrency issues
- more tests for [rpcserver](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2069)
- refactored [upgrade](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2457) logic to deduplicate and make it faster to write future upgrades

BCH fork

- how did the fork go?
- BCH moved to exchanges ahead of the hard fork https://twitter.com/philip_gradwell/status/1326452365004861440

Ethereum network experienced a [disruption](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-hard-fork-disruption) on Nov 11. Recent version of Geth node software silently fixed a consensus bug that was dormant for over a year. Since it changed consensus code, it had a risk of an unintended hard fork. One vendor discovered the bug independently and seeing that the majority of nodes have upgraded, decided to test it [in production](https://twitter.com/jinglanW/status/1326651349912719360) and see what would happen. To everyone's surprise, among the minority of nodes running old software was Infura, a popular service provider used by "dapps" to sync with Ethereum network. The bug-triggering transaction halted Infura and a bunch of "decentralized" finance apps that relied on it, including Metamask, MakerDAO, Uniswap, Compound, and others. Binance and other exchanges have also halted trading after noticing conflicting transaction histories. Infura resolved the issue within hours and posted a [post-mortem](https://blog.infura.io/infura-mainnet-outage-post-mortem-2020-11-11/) explaining why they didn't upgrade and calling out the danger of silent consensus fixes. Ethereum developer also published a [post-mortem](https://gist.github.com/karalabe/e1891c8a99fdc16c4e60d9713c35401f) for Geth, which explained that the fix was done silently to not attract unwanted attention from attackers. Among other things, the incident teaches us that deploying critical fixes is challenging because it is a trade-off between informing good actors while not informing bad ones.
