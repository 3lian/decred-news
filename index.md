# About

Decred Journal serves to expose just how much is happening in Decred and save the time for people unable to actively follow all project activity. It aims to cover all relevant developments with a short description and links to read further. It shows the depth of the project and the involvement of the community.

Monthly issues are published here via GitHub Pages, on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/search?q=decred+journal&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new) and on [Medium](https://medium.com/decred). Markdown source files and contribution guidelines are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news).
