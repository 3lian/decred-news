# About

This project was motivated by the desire to expose just how much is happening in Decred and save the time for people unable to actively follow our channels. It aims to cover all relevant developments with a short description and links to read further. It shows the depth of the project and the involvement of the community.

Posts are published here via GitHub Pages, on [Medium](https://medium.com/decred) and on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/search?q=decred+journal&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new).
