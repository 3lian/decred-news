# Decred Update — April 2018

## Development

Core software is heading to 1.2.0 release. If you can't wait to test upcoming features, get a Release Candidate version [here](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases).

The release process has changed. It used to be: call a set date, rush to make it, still miss some bugs and rush to make a bugfix release. Now it is: freeze feature set, post Release Candidate 1 (RC1) and let people start testing it, fix bugs and release RC2, repeat. An RC version with no apparent bugs becomes the final release. This new process removes a ton of pressure from developers (and traders) and outlines proper time for testing. As our primary consumer-facing product, Decrediton, is growing in features and complexity, more testing will be required for new releases.

Politeia is "Getting close to a public beta of voting" ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1523623105000168)). Decred plugin [merged](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/242), paywall and voting under development. Backend voting [works](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/984518284757221376) on testnet via CLI.

Trezor support advanced with Decred PR [merged](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/pull/274). Please note this is only firmware support, to be usable it also needs wallet integration.

## ASICs

Update from Obelisk:
> taek: We got results back. They are more or less on line with the simulations\
> I didn't realize this, but we don't get the real chips back for 3 more weeks. The ones we've been testing are hacked together into a DIP package (they are BGA chips) that really screws up the results\
> There's a decent chance that the full bga chips perform better\
> For the time being though, we're pretty much on track for the hashrates estimated on the website ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3P6R055Z/p1523504966000203))
> 
> taek: We are still on track [for June shipping of Obelisk]\
> We're also at 80% confidence to hit 1500 GH/s ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3P6R055Z/p1524152532000581))

Halong: units are reportedly shipping. The amount of units was estimated 450-600 by community member. Review of DragonMint B29 [published](https://bitsonline.com/dragonmint-b29-blake-256-decred-miner/), people are [discussing](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8a2vul/just_unboxed_my_dragonmint_b29s/) unboxing and shipping.

By surprise Innosilicon [released](http://www.innosilicon.com/html/d9-miner/index.html) D9 DecredMaster ASIC with specs [identical](https://www.hashespersecond.com/2018/04/18/innosilicon-releases-blake2b-blake256-miners-that-mirror-halong-offerings/) to Halong B29. Expected shipping date April 28-30. Discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8d7awu/innosilicon_releases_blake2b_blake256_miners_that/). As always, DYOR.

## Network

Hashrate reached new all time high near 4000 TH/s, followed by a sharp [drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8doiuo/question_about_network_hashrate_and_mining/) to around 2300 TH/s and is now recovering. Could be ASICs shipping.

There are 200 public listening nodes and 418 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). 31 nodes run version 1.2.0, meaning they are testing release candidate ahead of final release.

Stake participation is solid 46% with 3.5 million DCR. 30-day average ticket price is 86.5 DCR.

## Integrations

Brazilian community made a strong push of integrations this month.

emiliomann announced:

> the launch of first BR exchange of altcoins with fiat market and totally within the laws of the Brazilian government. Decred will have the two markets DCR/BTC and DCR/BRL. It’s very difficult to fulfill all the legal requirements and get authorization to work with FIAT here.

The exchange [turned](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/984105841048436741) to be Profitfy. It is outstanding because it comes from @Rhama, Decred community member from day one. And it is innovative, using dcrtime for their blockchain ID via [Original My](https://originalmy.com).

Seeing this competition, another exchange Braziliex [launched](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/984478905061928960) DCR/BRL and DCR/BTC pairs ahead of their plans only 2 hours after Profitfy.

Not stopping there,

> emiliomann: Hey guys, this is a poll of the biggest bitcoin exchange in brazil that is planning to open altcoins markets. Please, help the Brazilian community by voting for Decred! Just one click. Thank you! https://twitter.com/mercadobitcoin/status/981602483268194307

Next, changenow.io, a non-custodian exchange for fast conversions [added](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/981623403378454528) DCR.

> michae2xl: ‪Decred is now available on @ezBtcCanada - an exchange with trading pairs DCR/CAD. From Toronto - https://www.ezbtc.ca/trade/alt-coins

i2Rav announced a new [trading desk](https://i2trading.com/) that will be offering DCR/EUR pair.

> Eventually we hope to offer the pair in GBP and YEN as well

## Adoption

The Crypto Lawyers, a crypto exclusive U.S. law firm began accepting Decred ([discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8909x6/the_crypto_lawyers_a_crypto_exclusive_us_law_firm/)).

> RAurelius: I think that a law firm accepting Decred is a worthy distinction from other previously publicized companies that accept Decred for typical consumer products. Legal services are severely lacking in the Crypto-sphere, so the publicity is good for everyone in this arena.

Great to see business owners heading directly to our chats.

> emiliomann: VotoLegal, a brazilian project that uses blockchain technology to allow election campaign funding to be transparent and that all transactions conducted are tracked and made available to the citizen, now uses DCRtime and Decred Blockchain ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C0NRMDVMJ/p1524065250000150), [twitter](https://twitter.com/decred_br/status/986610826051276800)).

## Partnerships

YBF Ventures and Decred announced partnership in building a blockchain-focused development and business hub in Australia.

> With the YBF Ventures partnership, Decred hopes to grow their Australian contractor network and scale their operations throughout the Asia-Pacific region. ([btcmanager.com](https://btcmanager.com/ybf-ventures-partners-with-the-decred-project-to-build-a-decentralized-internet/))

> We specifically chose Decred for a more robust corporate partnership, and it is the first time that a decentralised autonomous organisation is partnering with a ‘traditional’ organisation in such a capacity. ([ybfventures.com](http://ybfventures.com/ybf-decred-partnership-web-3/)).

## Discussions

A debate on protocol security and cost to attack ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/89mvfd/key_security_flaws_in_decred_limits_the_security/)).

Very thoughtful discussion on how appropriate it is to use half naked photos in marketing, followed by meta-discussion how to handle very polarizing issues and association of unwanted materials to a decentralized project ([slack](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C5HPHMFQF/p1524182971000248), continued [here](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C3PAYQJTW/p1524304298000029)).

A new #governance channel to discuss governance in Decred and other projects.

[r/politeia](https://www.reddit.com/r/politeia/) subreddit was recovered for Decred community. Thanks to Tivra for filing the request. Politeia can bring a lot of value outside Decred so it well deserves its own sub.
