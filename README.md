This repository hosts Markdown sources of the Decred Journal project. Currently deployed at https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/ and mirrored on Reddit and Medium.

Contributions are welcome in all areas: collection, writing, pre-release review, translations and deciding things like content and structure. Please see [open issues](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues).

Expect rebases on master since the Git workflow is not stable yet (see [this issue](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/25)).
